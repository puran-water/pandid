"""Where the sheet is cut in two: process, then control.

A P&ID is drawn in that order and read in that order. The pipes and the
equipment they join are the drawing; the instrumentation is furniture
hung on it afterwards, and a signal wire has never moved a pipe. The
engine draws the same boundary:

- **Stage 1, process.** Every unit that carries material, and every
  stream of kind ``"material"``. Positioned, coordinated and routed.
- **Stage 2, control.** Every instrument -- attached to a host *and*
  free-standing -- and every signal run, placed against stage 1's
  frozen geometry and then routed around it.

The old engine cut at *has a host* instead, which is a different line in
two ways that both hurt. A free-standing controller carried a rank, so
the signal from its transmitter was read as a step along the flow and
pushed it a full column east; and the control loop it closed was a cycle
in the flow graph, so phase 0 tore one of its wires and the two ends of
that wire were then placed with no relationship to each other. Cutting
at process-versus-control leaves no control loop in the flow graph to
tear.

Freezing stage 1 also breaks the loop behind
:data:`~pandid.layout.attach.MAX_PLACEMENT_PASSES`: a balloon can no
longer move a process line, so placement and routing stop chasing each
other. The cost is that a signal line can never ask a process line to
move aside, and for a P&ID that is the correct priority.
