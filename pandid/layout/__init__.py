"""Layout Engine orchestrator.

The layout engine computes geometry (each unit's Frame) from topology,
and it draws the sheet in the order a draughtsman does: the process
first, then the instrumentation onto it.

**Stage 1, process.** Every unit that carries material and every stream
of kind ``"material"``.

- Cycle breaking, so a return line is known to be one.
- Placement (:mod:`pandid.layout.place`): two weighted least-squares
  fits, one per axis, over what the equipment says about where its
  neighbours are drawn (:mod:`pandid.layout.claims`), solved in closed
  form by :mod:`pandid.layout.solver`. A column says its condenser is
  north east of it and its reboiler south east; every stream states two
  such claims, one from each end, and the fit is the compromise between
  all of them weighted by how hard each unit insists.
- Coordinates (:mod:`pandid.layout.coordinates`): grid to pixels, folded
  into bands where the ribbon is wider than paper, and with the space
  the instrumentation will need already reserved
  (:mod:`pandid.layout.halo`).

**Stage 2, control.** Every instrument, attached and free-standing, and
every signal run, placed against stage 1's frozen geometry
(:mod:`pandid.layout.control`).

Two phases follow, both of which need every drawn box to be final:
port-face selection, then label placement. Their order is load-bearing:
a label goes to a face no connected nozzle occupies, so it has to be
told which faces those are.

Face selection and stage 2 do not settle in a single pass, and they are
run to a fixed point rather than in an order. A balloon hung on a
*stream* lands on that stream's drawn path, and where the path leaves
each end is the face selection's answer -- while the selection reads the
boxes, of which the balloon is one. Neither can go first: run once, the
first ``layout()`` placed such a balloon from the faces a symbol defaults
to and the second placed it from the faces the first chose, so laying a
sheet out twice did not draw it twice the same.
``examples/04_control_loop.py``'s interlock, hung on the signal between
two balloons, moved 16px on the second run.
