"""The space a process unit has to leave for the balloons hung on it.

Stage 1 places the equipment and stage 2 places the instrumentation
against it. If stage 1 packs the boxes as though the sheet were empty,
stage 2 packs into space that is already gone -- which is a bubble drawn
over the vessel it reads (#428), and it gets worse exactly as a sheet
gets more instrumented.

So a unit's *effective* footprint is its own box plus whatever hangs off
it: the balloon on its crown, the transmitter beside that, the
controller beside that again. The demand is computable before anything
is drawn, because a balloon's position is its host, a face or a
fraction, an offset and an angle, and only the first of those is
unknown at this point.

A balloon on a **stream** is charged to both of the units that stream
joins. Where the tap lands along the run is not known yet, so the run
is treated as though the balloon could be anywhere on it; over-reserving
the two ends is the safe direction, and the alternative -- reserving
nothing and finding out afterwards -- is the defect this exists to stop.
