"""What each unit says about where its neighbours are drawn.

Vertical position on a P&ID is **not** elevation. A condenser is drawn
top right of its column because that reads clearly and keeps the runs
from crossing, not because it stands on a structure above it. It is a
drafting convention, and the only thing that knows it is the equipment:
a column knows its overhead goes up and to the right and its reboiler
down and to the right, and no amount of looking at the pipe will tell
you that.

So the equipment says it, in two class attributes
(:attr:`~pandid.units.Unit.PLACES` and
:attr:`~pandid.units.Unit.LAYOUT_CONFIDENCE`), and this module reads
them off the sheet as :class:`Claim` s.

One shape for everything
------------------------
``Claim(author, subject, eastward, southward, confidence)``. The
``author`` asserts; the ``subject`` is asserted upon. ``eastward`` and
``southward`` are relative **steps**, not coordinates, and are named for
their sign: ``+1 southward`` is a row further down a y-down canvas,
which ``dy`` invites a reader to get backwards.

**A stream states one claim for each end that has something to say.**
Where both do they are independent and may flatly disagree -- a column's
``overhead -> NE`` and its condenser's own reading of its inlet face are
two different statements about the same pair -- and the solve
(:mod:`pandid.layout.solver`) arbitrates by weight rather than by
dropping one of them. That is what lets every block have a say, and it
is why nothing here has to decide which end is right.

Where **neither** end has anything to say the pipe states one claim on
its own account, and a return line is always that case (see below). The
approved design in #447 said *two* claims per stream, unconditionally.
That is amended here, deliberately: a valve has no opinion about where
its line goes, and a claim written on its behalf is not its opinion but
an invention -- and an invented claim is still a weight in the fit.
Emitting one anyway -- a confidence-0 end stating what the *pipe*
states, at :data:`LINE`, which is exactly what makes it two claims per
stream unconditionally -- costs the corpus 38 crossings, 246 to 284,
and buys a symmetry that is in the code rather than in the equipment.

What the two-claim contract was there to prevent still holds, and it is
the half that matters: **no end is ever dropped because the other end
spoke.** A stream with one stated end and one silent end states the one,
never "whichever of the two is better".

Where a direction comes from
----------------------------
Three levels, best first, all at the author's own confidence:

1. **:attr:`~pandid.units.Unit.PLACES`**, the drafting convention this
   kind of equipment draws to. Looked up by port name, then by the
   family name a numbered family shares, so ``feed`` covers ``feed_1``
   through ``feed_8``.
2. **The face the nozzle is fixed to**, where the symbol leaves it no
   choice (:func:`fixed_face`). A west nozzle says its peer is west.
   Note what this is *not*: it is the author's own guess about its own
   nozzle, worth exactly the author's confidence, and no longer the
   binary fact the engine before this one tried to build an order out
   of. A column overhead and a condenser inlet both facing north used to
   cancel to nothing and let the barycentre draw the tower upside down
   (#446); here they are two weak opinions that a strong ``PLACES``
   overrules.

   A class **stops the ladder here** by mapping a nozzle to ``None``:
   that nozzle's face is artwork and nothing else, and the class has no
   view on where its peer is drawn. What that is for is the **service**
   connection -- a heater's steam supply, a filter's regenerant, a
   furnace's fuel gas. Steam enters a heater from below because that is
   where the symbol draws the nozzle, and where the steam *header*
   belongs on the sheet is not the heater's business. Read as a claim it
   was five heaters at confidence 2 each asserting their supply lay
   south of them, against a header with no opinion of its own, and the
   header sank below every consumer it fed -- 24 crossings on a sheet
   two pins draw cleanly (#459).
3. **Flow order**: the destination is one step east of the source. A
   recycle is the same statement backwards, since a return line is drawn
   right to left and its two ends are already ordered by the forward run
   it returns along.

   This one is **not** at the author's confidence. It is what the *pipe*
   says, not what the unit says: a unit whose nozzle has a menu nobody
   has picked from, or whose class declared the nozzle empty, has stated
   nothing at all, and weighing that silence as heavily as a stated
   convention makes silence argue. Concretely, a feed over a block's
   roof: the block states north, the feed's silence is read as "east of
   me", the two weigh the same, and the fit splits the difference and
   draws the feed diagonally off the corner. So flow order weighs
   :data:`LINE`, wherever it comes from.

Confidence 0, and why the line still speaks
-------------------------------------------
A valve, a fitting or a reducer sets
:attr:`~pandid.units.Unit.LAYOUT_CONFIDENCE` to 0: it sits *in* the line
and has no opinion about where the line goes. Its claims are dropped,
which is not the same as weighing them 1 -- a train with a dozen block
valves on it would otherwise stiffen the vessel at the end of it by 12
and drown out the column arguing with it.

Dropped claims cannot be allowed to disconnect the sheet, though: a run
of valves between two valves would leave a component with nothing
joining it to anything, and a component the solve anchors on its own is
a component drawn on top of the sheet. So a stream **both** of whose
ends declined to speak contributes one claim of its own at
:data:`LINE`, the weakest weight there is, saying only what a pipe says:
that the thing it leaves comes before the thing it reaches.

What a fitting is *not* given is a claim toward the middle of its two
neighbours. That is the obvious reading of "a valve sits on the line
rather than at a place on the grid", and this grid cannot draw it: the
midpoint of two boxes one column apart is half a column, which
discretises onto one of them, and
:func:`~pandid.layout.place._separate` then hands the valve a **row** of
its own -- lifting it off the very line it was supposed to be sitting
on.

Measured, because "cannot draw it" is worth a number, and stated
exactly enough to run again. In :func:`read`, where a confidence-0
end is dropped, emit ``Claim(author, subject, 0, 0, LINE)`` instead
and count that end as having spoken. Once per **end**, not once per
run, and the two are not the same rule: of the corpus's 422
non-recycle process runs 174 have one confidence-0 end and 146 have
two, so per-end emits 466 of these claims where per-run would emit
320. Per-end is also what puts the fitting in the middle -- each of
its own two runs pulls it onto the neighbour at the far end, and
least squares splits them. That takes the corpus from **246
crossings to 475**. Blunting it does not rescue it either: keep those
claims out of :func:`~pandid.layout.place._spread`'s list and nowhere
else, so the fit reads the midpoint while the fitting still takes a
column of its own, and it is **516**.

Every corpus-wide crossing figure in this module -- 246, 284, 309,
475, 516 -- is one measurement, and it is worth saying which:
``scripts/layout_quality.py``'s **auto-placed** corpus, which is the
21 shipped examples with every ``pin()`` placement stripped, its
per-sheet crossings summed. Those same 21 sheets pinned as their
authors wrote them draw 32 between them, so a crossing count quoted
without saying which corpus it counted is out by most of itself.

Drawing a fitting *between* two columns rather than in one is a
question for :mod:`pandid.layout.coordinates`, which owns where a
column's paper begins and ends, and not for the claims.
