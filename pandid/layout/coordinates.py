"""Stage 1 geometry: grid positions to pixels, band by band.

A unit's position is ``(band, column, row)``. The column and the row
come from :mod:`pandid.layout.place`; the band is decided here, because
it is the one part of the position that is about *paper* rather than
about the process, and paper is the first thing this module knows about.

Why the band cannot be applied afterwards
-----------------------------------------
Cutting a solved ribbon at ``x > W`` and dropping the tail underneath
looks like the cheap way to wrap, and it is wrong by construction: a
stream crossing the cut now runs right to left, so the unit whose *west*
nozzle carries it sits east of its peer -- reintroducing exactly the
inconsistency between geometry and nozzle that the constraint solver
exists to remove. So the band is part of the position and the ribbon is
cut where the drawing has a seam, not where the ruler falls.

:func:`assign_labels` closes the run but is a separate phase the engine
calls after :mod:`pandid.layout.faces` has chosen the movable ports'
faces, since a label dodges the faces the nozzles actually leave from.
