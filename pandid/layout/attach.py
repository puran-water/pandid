"""Instrument attachment: balloons anchored to a line or to equipment.

A P&ID bubble is not a node in the process flow; it is furniture hung
off a tap point. So an attached instrument takes no part in stage 1 (it
has no column and no row) and its frame comes from its host instead: a
point on the host stream's routed path, or the midpoint of a face of the
host unit's drawn box, pushed out along a branch direction measured from
the flow. The space it will need is reserved before stage 1 places
anything -- see :mod:`pandid.layout.halo` -- so what it lands in is
paper nothing else was allowed to take.

The tap point is resolved through :mod:`pandid.portgeom`, so a balloon
can never disagree with the nozzle geometry the router and renderer see.

The tap is the anchor and never moves; the *standoff* -- how far out and
in which direction -- is the only thing this module may choose, and it
chooses it against everything already on the sheet. See
:func:`_clear_standoff`.

**Unless the author placed it.** A balloon carries a
:class:`~pandid.geometry.Pin` like any other unit, and an absolute
``x``/``y`` on one is honoured here, per axis, in place of the standoff
this module would have chosen (#467). It is not a rank -- there is no
grid for a bubble to stand in -- and ``col``/``row`` on one is still
nothing this sweep can read, which
:func:`pandid.validate.geometry_issues` reports as ``pin-not-honored``.

#: Placing and routing chase each other: a balloon is placed on its

#: then avoids, which can bend that very path. Every sheet shipped here
#: settles in one or two passes and the worst converging sheet found by
#: search took four, but there is no quantity the recursion descends,
#: and sheets do exist that cycle between two or three arrangements

#: How far out :func:`_clear_standoff` walks a balloon that collides,

#:
#: A step is the balloon's own radius. Shorter, and a box only just
#: clear of one obstacle needs several steps to clear the next; longer,
#: and the first free ring is further out than the drawing needed.
#: Eight of them is enough to walk a bubble clear of the tallest vessel
#: in the corpus, and a search that runs out returns the least-bad
#: standoff rather than growing without bound.

SWEEP_STEP = 15.0

#: How near the host's own reference direction a swept angle may come.
#: That reference is the flow at a stream tap and the face tangent on a
#: unit host, so a branch along it lays the balloon *on* the line it
#: reads or flat against the face it is mounted on. Both are clear of
#: every box on the sheet and neither can be read, which is exactly the
#: kind of answer a box-overlap search would otherwise be delighted with.
MIN_BRANCH = 20.0

#: What a balloon the search *had* to move clears its neighbours by.
#:
#: Nothing is ever moved in order to reach it: the standoff the author
#: asked for is kept whenever it merely does not overlap, which is what
#: leaves a bubble deliberately set a pixel off a primary element (11's
#: FT-303 on FE-303) exactly where it was put. The clearance applies
#: only once a collision has already forced a different standoff, and
#: then it is the difference between a balloon that reads as separate
#: and one that is separate by a hair.
RESOLVED_CLEARANCE = 6.0

#: How much room in front of a nozzle a *moved* balloon leaves the
#: router. ``VisibilityGraph`` stands every run off its nozzle before it
#: may turn, by this much or more -- more where a label has to be
#: cleared, but the label pass has not run the first time a balloon is
#: placed, so the bare stand-off is the one figure true at every call.
#: Under-stating it leaves a nozzle the router can still escape from;
#: over-stating it would walk bubbles out past corridors nothing needs.
ESCAPE_ROOM = 25.0

#: The overlap :func:`pandid.validate.validate` tolerates before it
#: calls two boxes collided -- its ``_TOL``, restated rather than
#: imported so that a layout phase does not reach into the checker's
#: privates. ``tests/test_instruments.py`` pins the two together, because
#: a search that resolved to a tighter rule than the check would report
#: overlaps it had just declared itself finished with.
