"""Stage 2: the instrumentation, against frozen process geometry.

Every balloon on the sheet lands here, and the process boxes are read
and never written. A balloon with a host resolves against it, exactly as
it always has (:func:`~pandid.layout.attach.place_attached`); a
free-standing one -- a controller in a panel, a logic square between two
loops -- has no host to resolve against, so it is put near the things it
is wired to, in the nearest space nothing else has claimed.

The old engine ranked a free-standing balloon with the equipment, and
the signal into it was read as a step along the process: a controller
was pushed a full column east of its transmitter, and the loop it closed
became a cycle the flow graph then had to be torn to break. Placing it
here instead is what leaves no control loop in the flow graph at all.
