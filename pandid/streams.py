"""Stream: a connection from one outlet Port to one inlet Port.

`name` is the stream number. On an auto-named stream the flowsheet owns
it and keeps it equal to what gets drawn; a name passed to `connect()`
is never touched. Setting any of `size`, `schedule`, `service`, `spec`
or `insulation` turns that number into a full line number
(`6"-P-1001-A1A`), assembled by the flowsheet's `line_numbering_scheme`.
`kind` is one of `STREAM_KINDS`: a process kind ("material"/"energy") on
a pipe, a signal kind on an instrument line. `is_recycle` is COMPUTED
later by the layout engine's cycle-detection phase and must never be set
by API callers. `draw_as_recycle` lets a caller nudge which stream is
chosen as a tear/back-edge in ambiguous cycles; it is advisory only.
`color` and `dasharray` are checked as they are set -- see
`check_color` -- because they are instructions to the renderer rather
than lettering, and an instruction it cannot read is dropped silently.
