# Every width this file draws in comes off :class:`~.weights.LineWeight`

# element is on is stated at the point it is drawn; the ladder itself,
# and why it is three rungs at 4:2:1 rather than the two this file used
# to hold, is in :mod:`pandid.render.weights`.
#
# What #490 moved is one assignment: a material run is ISO 10628-1
# §5.3.1 a) and not b). It had been drawn at the same 2 units as the
# vessel it enters -- a coherent reading of ISO 15519-2 Annex A.1, which
# spends two widths across pipeline (A.1.01) and instrument and signal
# line (A.1.02, A.1.03), but not the reading 10628-1 §5.3.1 states for
# the documents this library draws.

#: The dash a signal line is drawn with, per kind. A pneumatic line is
#: absent because it is drawn *solid* and cross-hatched instead. Held at
#: module scope because the draw.io export writes the same line, and two
#: tables of dashes would be two answers to what an electric signal
#: looks like.
_SIGNAL_DASH = {"electric": "7,4", "data": "9,3,2,3", "software": "9,3,2,3",
                "capillary": "3,3"}

#: The dash a tap line is drawn with where it carries a measurement or a
#: command rather than process fluid; an impulse line is solid. See
#: :meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_taps` and :func:`impulse_tap`. Here beside
#: the signal dashes and for the same reason: the export writes it too.
_TAP_DASH = "5,4"


#: The radius of the semicircle a crossing line hops with, which is half
#: the length of run the hop takes out and how far it stands off it.
#: :meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_streams` builds the arc from this alone.
#:
#: Named for the same reason :data:`_TAP_DASH` is, and with arithmetic
#: in the way: draw.io sizes its own hop from a ``jumpSize``, where
#: ``mxConnector.paintLine`` makes the half-extent ``(jumpSize - 2) / 2
#: + strokeWidth``. That is a different number, and
#: :func:`pandid.render.drawio._jump_size` solves it for this radius.
#:
#: **Derived from the pen since #490, because it has to be.** The paper
#: the arc leaves against the run it bridges is the radius less a
#: half-pen of each::
#:
#:     clearance = HOP_R - w_hop / 2 - w_crossed / 2
#:
#: Left at the flat 5 it was, a run widening from 2 units to
#: :attr:`~.weights.LineWeight.MAIN_FLOW`'s 4 took that from 3 units to
#: **1, 0,25 mm** -- measured on the raster, not only computed -- and at
#: that width the crescent closes: the arc, the run it crosses and the
#: corner beside it merge into one shape, and the mark states a junction
#: where there is none. A tight crossing is a defect; one that reads as
#: a tee is a false statement, so the radius follows the rung.
#:
#: :data:`_HOP_CLEARANCE` is the paper the sheet has always left there,
#: and the term added to it is a half-pen of each of two main flow runs
#: -- the widest pair that can meet -- so the clearance is a floor for
#: every crossing and exact for that one.
#:
#: **No clause sizes this**, and none is cited as if it did. §5.3.2's
#: floor is between *parallel* lines and does not reach a crossing, and
#: nothing in §5.3.4, ISO 15519-1 §12.5 or ISO 15519-2 Table A.1 gives
#: the gap a dimension. The number below restores what the drawing had
#: and claims nothing further.
#:
#: **Nor is the arc itself specified anywhere.** §5.3.4 draws an
#: interruption, 15519-1 §12.5 draws a plain crossing, and none of the
#: three reference sheets in ``professional_examples/`` marks a crossing
#: at all -- 393 of 393 interior crossings are plain. An arc is a
#: drafting convention this library brought with it, and which of the
#: three a sheet should draw is #499, with the prototype and the
#: measurements on it.
#:
#: The radius cannot simply be raised to whatever would be comfortable.
#: ``_draw_streams`` only marks a segment longer than twice it, so a
#: larger radius *drops* crossings -- 2 of the corpus's 53 at 7 and 5 at
#: 12 -- and an interruption wide enough to clear the run eats the run
#: it is cut into instead, leaving 0,25 mm stubs of pipe beside a corner
#: on this same corpus. Both conventions meet the same wall: the router
#: puts crossings within a few units of a corner
#: (``pandid.routing.separation``, whose spacing is 6 units and is
#: derived from nothing), and at 0,4 M no crossing mark of any shape
#: fits in what it leaves. That is #498.
#:
#: The two crossings that go unmarked here are drawn plain, which is
#: ambiguous where the merged arc was wrong -- the same trade
#: :data:`~pandid.render.drawio.HOP_DROPPED` already makes, and the way
#: every crossing on all three reference sheets is drawn.
_HOP_CLEARANCE = 3.0
HOP_R = _HOP_CLEARANCE + LineWeight.MAIN_FLOW.width

#: How a crossing of two unconnected runs is marked. **The author's
#: choice**, because the documents on disk do not agree on one --
#: :data:`HOP_R`'s note above sets out the reading, and #499 settled it
#: as a choice rather than a fix.
#:
#: * ``"arc"`` -- the semicircular bridge, and the default, so that no
#:   drawing already issued changes. It is in no standard this project
#:   holds and on none of the reference sheets; it is a drafting
#:   convention this library brought with it.
#: * ``"gap"`` -- the interruption ISO 10628-1 5.3.4 prescribes. Drawn
#:   over the same ``2 * HOP_R`` of run the arc spans, because no clause
#:   dimensions it and matching the arc's footprint is the one choice
#:   that invents no number and moves nothing else on the sheet. **It
#:   costs run**: the break comes out of the line rather than being laid
#:   over it, so a crossing near a corner leaves a short leg. Measured
#:   on this corpus at this radius: of the 84 resulting pieces of run,
#:   3 keep a straight leg under 1 mm -- 0,15 mm at the worst, on
#:   ``11_ethanol_pid`` -- and the shortest whole piece is 1,5 mm. The
#:   arc meets the same wall from the other side (it drops 1 of 50
#:   crossings), and both are the router putting crossings within a few
#:   units of a corner, which is #498.
#: * ``"plain"`` -- both lines continuous, as ISO 15519-1 12.5 Figure 31
#:   draws a crossing and as all 393 interior crossings on the reference
#:   sheets are drawn. A junction is then told from a crossing by the
#:   *junction* carrying a mark, which is the other way round from the
#:   two above.
#:
#: The choice is the **sheet's** and not the line's: a drawing that
#: marked some crossings one way and some another would teach its reader
#: a convention and then break it, which is worse than either. See
#: :func:`check_crossing_style`.
CROSSING_STYLES = ("arc", "gap", "plain")

#: What a crossing is drawn as when the author says nothing.
#:
#: ISO 10628-1 5.3.4 asks for an interruption and describes no other mark,
#: and 4.1 puts every diagram this package draws -- block, PFD and P&ID
#: alike -- under Clause 5, so the rule does not vary by diagram type.
#: The arc is a drafting convention this library brought with it and no
#: document here specifies; it stays available because a house style may
#: want it, but it is no longer what a sheet gets by default.
#:

# ``professional_examples/P&ID_301.pdf`` bears that out: all three of
# its annotated controllers put their alarms on whichever side has room.
# So a pair keeps its half of the symbol and takes whichever side reads.

# measured-variable type for letter code U, and (c) high functions with

    counted in. Whether the label needs a leader is :func:`_along`'s
    separate question.

    On the pipe only while the run can still show clear line at each
    end; then beside it (above a horizontal run, left of a vertical
    one), then the far side, then further out. Each is slid along the
    run in turn, so the label leaves the pipe before it leaves the
    neighbourhood of its own line. Above and left is the side ISO
    15519-1 §7.2.5 asks for, as a ``should``; on the pipe comes first
    anyway, a dozen-character line number costing the sheet more room
    beside the run than on it.

    On the pipe the label has to stay within the run, clearance and all.
    Beside it, it erases nothing, so it may slide until its near edge
    reaches the run's end -- far enough to get out from under a symbol
    the run butts into, and no further.

    ``on_run`` is the label that may not leave its line at all, which is
    what an enclosure asks for (#480). Both of the rules above are then
    suspended: the run's clear length no longer decides whether the
    label may sit on it, and the bands beside it are never offered. A
    diamond's whole grammar is *the run passes through me*, so one
    written beside the line, or out on a leader, is a symbol a reader
    cannot identify -- while one that will not fit is merely crowded,
    and crowding is the author's to fix by spacing the sheet. The slide
    that is left is what lets the search still dodge; where even that is
    spent, :data:`_slide` yields the centre alone and the label stays
    there.

    ``plate`` is how much of the label *along the run* is opaque, where
    that is less than the whole of it: the words inside an enclosure,
    the enclosure itself being an outline the run is seen straight
    through (:func:`_enclosure_svg`). The slide is bounded by it rather
    than by ``hw``, and that is one rule and not two -- what has to keep
    clear line at each end is the paper the label paints, because that
    is the only part of it a reader could take for the end of the run.
    Bounding the slide by the shape instead leaves every label whose
    shape outruns its segment -- 70 of the 286 on the shipped corpus at
    ``"diamond"`` -- with no slide at all, pinned to the middle of the
    segment whatever happens to cross there, which is where four of the

# --- the leader that stands in for adjacency --------------------------
# ISO 15519-1 §6.4 gives a leader three terminators and picks between
# them by where the leader lands: a dot inside an object, an arrowhead on
# the outline of an object or on a connection, an oblique stroke across
# several parallel connections. A line number's leader ends on a
# connection, so it wears an arrowhead, and Figure 4 c) draws the leader
# itself *oblique*, running down onto a plain horizontal connecting line
# with the text at its upper end.
#
# The slope is load-bearing. §12.1 holds the connecting lines -- pipes,
# mechanical links, conductors, functional connections and the rest --
# to horizontal or vertical, and it is being oblique that keeps a leader
# from being read as one of those, which is why
# tests/test_route_invariants.py sweeps streams and impulse lines and
# not this.
#
# The head is ambiguous against the sheet's own flow marker, and
# knowingly so: both are a solid filled triangle, this one at 1,8 times
# the size, with nothing else telling them apart. §6.4 offers no other
# terminator, so what pays the ambiguity down is drawing fewer leaders
# -- §7.2.5 wants the number along its line and treats the leader as
# what to do when that is impossible. See :func:`_along`.

# Half the sheet's flow arrowhead: §6.4 hands the leader to ISO 128-22,
# where it is a narrow line, and a terminator heavier than the line it
# ends would read as the weightier of the two. Same proportions as the
# flow head, so the two are one drawing at two sizes.
#
# A *size*, and half outright. It was written as the ratio between two
# line weights that happened to stand at 2:1, which made a glyph's size
# a function of a width -- so #490's widening of the main flow rung
# would have shrunk this head to a quarter of the flow head without
# anything in the drawing asking it to. A width and a size are
# different quantities and this is the one place they were tied.

    interruption occupy the same ``2 * HOP_R`` of run, so a crossing has
    the room for one exactly when it has the room for the other, and
    :data:`CROSSING_STYLES` changes only the noun in the sentence
    :func:`_crossing_issues` writes. ``"plain"`` returns nothing: a
    sheet that marks no crossing anywhere drew every one of them the way
    it said it would, and a finding against each would be a finding
    against the option rather than against the drawing.

    **That is not a neutral fallback on this sheet.** A drawing on which
    every other crossing carries an arc has taught its reader that a
    crossing looks like an arc, so a bare one does not read as "no
    information" -- it reads as the other thing, a junction. The
    reference sheets get away with drawing every crossing bare because
    they draw *all* of them bare and mark the junctions instead; a sheet
    that does both cannot borrow that. So the sheet says so rather than
    leaving the reader to find it: :meth:`SvgRenderer.render` turns each
    of these into a :data:`CROSSING_UNMARKED` warning naming both runs
    and the point.

    Returns ``(marked, crossed, x, y)`` per crossing, where *marked* is
    the run that would have carried the arc. The room test is the one
    ``_draw_streams`` applies, and ``tests/test_render.py``'s
    ``test_a_hop_has_room_for_its_own_arc`` holds the two to agreeing:
    it counts the arcs actually drawn against the crossings that have
    room, so a drift here shows up there.

    Widening a run is what made this worth reporting -- at 0,4 M an arc
    needs more room than it did (see :data:`HOP_R`) -- but the condition
    is older than #490 and the count on the shipped corpus is 2 of 53.
    Giving those two the room is the router's to do, and is #498.

    Returns ``((start, end), crossings)``: the leader, the end being the
    point on the run the arrowhead lands on, and how many of *occupied*
    it cuts through.

    Every candidate leaves the halo's **near face** and lands 45 degrees
    away along the run -- the slope Figure 4 draws. Leaving from the
    label rather than aiming at a fixed point on the run is what makes a
    leader *move* when the search slides the label along; pinned to the
    run, every anchor in a band produced the same leader.

    The tail is swept along that face and scored, in this order:

    **What it cuts**, first, for the reason the halo dodges anything at
    all. The strip of paper directly between a label and its run is
    often the congestion that pushed the label out, so a leader dropping
    out of the middle of the face is aimed straight into it and one
    leaving from nearer an end takes it around.

    **How near 45 degrees it lands**, second. It is the same slope on
    every leader on the sheet, so a reader learns the mark once.

    **How near the middle of the face it starts**, last. A halo is
    measured at 6,2 per character plus padding, which over-measures a
    string as hyphen-heavy as a line number by the better part of a
    character at each end, so its corners are blank paper and a tail
    landing there does not touch the words at all. The sweep is inset
    from the corners by half the halo's thickness, about one character
    at this size.

    The landing point is kept off the ends of the run, since those are
    where it meets the equipment it serves and a head there points at
    the vessel as readily as at the pipe -- the very reading the clause
    exists to prevent. The clearance is ``_LABEL_CLEAR``, or a third of
    the run where the run is too short to give that much; where the
    clamp bites the leader comes in shallower than 45 degrees, which is
    still oblique, and the second key spends the sweep's freedom getting
    back towards 45.

    ``keep_out`` extends that clearance by whatever the run's ends are
    *marked* with, and is the same clause rather than a new one: on a
    flanged sheet the joint is drawn, so landing on it points at the
    joint exactly as landing at the end points at the vessel. Measured
    off the run's ends before the inset, which is what lets a short
    spool with a flange pair at each end put the head in the clear
    middle.

    Lifted out of :meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_streams` for the reason
    :func:`stream_polyline` was, and for a second reason that cost the
    drawing a run: the hop is the one piece of a line whose geometry is
    **not** in the route. :func:`_ink` measured the straight path and
    nothing else, so a plate could sit clear of the run by half a
    millimetre and still take a bite out of the arc standing over it --
    which is what happened to ``S-939``'s hop under ``S-934``'s number
    on ``21_alumina_refinery``, on ``main`` and at every setting of
    ``fs.stream_labels.enclosure``. A hop is the worst thing on the
    sheet to erase: it exists solely to say *these two lines cross and
    are not joined*, and cut in half it says the opposite. So the
    derivation is one function, and the pass that draws it and the pass
    that dodges it read the same answer.

    **Which run hops** is ``direction``: a vertical segment crossing a
    horizontal one hops it, or the other way round under
    ``"horizontal"``. Strictly inside both, so a run that merely ends on
    another is a junction and is not hopped, and strictly far enough
    inside the hopping segment for the arc's two feet
    (:data:`HOP_R`) to land on it.

    **Any other spelling is refused, and used not to be.** This read
    ``direction`` the way the drawing pass used to read it, against the
    two names it knows and no others, so ``jump_direction="vertcial"``
    hopped nothing and drew every crossing flat -- a drawing that says
    two lines meet where they cross, which is the same lie a severed hop
    tells, told the other way round. There is no third value to mean
    "no hops": :meth:`SvgRenderer.render` documents two, and a sheet
    that wants none is a sheet with no crossings on it.

    The refusal is :func:`check_jump_direction`'s sentence and not a
    second one: #492 gave the parameter a closed set and a message, and
    a value checked against two spellings of one set is how a set stops
    being closed. What is here is the **second door**. #492 refuses at
    :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet._prepare_to_draw`, before the
    sheet is touched, which is where an author's typo should be caught;
    this catches the caller who reaches the geometry without going
    through a flowsheet at all, which is the argument
    :func:`enclosure_shape` makes for its own re-check. Neither replaces
    the other, and the read site is the one that makes it impossible to
    *use* the value without having checked it.

    **Which way it bulges** follows from the direction of travel and
    SVG's sweep flag, which is always ``1``: on a screen whose y runs
    down, that is clockwise, so a run drawn downwards bulges right and
    one drawn upwards bulges left; a run drawn rightwards bulges up and
    one drawn leftwards bulges down. The arc is a semicircle, so the
    side is the whole of the difference between the paper it covers and
    the paper beside it.

    Returned as the enclosure's own bounding box, measured along the
    words by across them; a label on a vertical run turns the pair over
    with everything else about it.

    The diamond and the circle are the **smallest of their kind
    containing the rectangle**, so neither is a size somebody had to
    choose. The box is not, and cannot be: the smallest rectangle
    containing a rectangle is that rectangle, and a rule drawn on the
    plate's own edge is a rule through the words -- the plate is what
    :data:`_HALO_CHAR` and :data:`_HALO_DEEP` measure the *glyphs*
    into, with no paper left over on the long sides. So the box is the
    one shape here carrying a chosen number, :data:`_ENCLOSURE_PAD`,
    and that constant is where the choice is argued.

    * ``diamond`` -- a **square turned through 45 degrees**: the
      smallest one containing the halo, so its diagonal is the halo's
      width plus its depth. Put a corner of the rectangle on the edge
      and the containment condition is ``p/a + q/b <= 1``; a square has
      ``a = b = d``, which gives ``d = (hw + hh) / 2`` and a box of
      ``hw + hh`` each way.

      Not the minimum-area rhombus, which is what this drew until the
      shape was measured on a sheet. That one doubles each half-side
      independently (``a = 2p``, ``b = 2q``), and on a two- or
      three-character number the words are much wider than they are
      deep, so it came out a long flat lozenge -- wider than the square
      by half again, which is the direction that matters, because a
      stream number sits *along* its run and it is the reach either side
      that collides with the next fitting. It costs about 3% in area and
      returns the shape a drawing office actually rules.
    * ``circle`` -- the circumscribed circle, diameter the halo's
      diagonal. Much the tightest of the three on a long label, since it
      pays for the corners once rather than twice. It is also what an
      ISA balloon is drawn as, which is why it is not the default and
      why :class:`~pandid.document.StreamLabelOptions` says so for a

    **The shape fills nothing, and the plate inside it erases nothing
    but the label's own run.** Those are the two halves of one rule, and
    together they are what lets an enclosure cost the drawing no ink
    that is not its own.

    A shape filled white is an opaque plate the size of a diamond, and a
    diamond is large -- twice the words in each direction -- so over the
    twenty-one shipped sheets, at the placement this file draws today,
    one would erase **1154 square units of drawn ink in 26 places**.
    Measured off the rendered document, by sampling each shape against
    the stroke every other run actually lays down: an area taken off
    :func:`_ink` instead is reservation area, the stroke padded by a
    whole stroke width, and this file of all files may not offer one for
    the other -- its own finding was that ``_ink`` is not the drawing.
    **Clipping a unit and deleting a line are not the same damage.** A block crowded by a diamond is a crowded drawing, and
    #480 decided the author spaces the sheet; a pipe with a bite out of
    it is a *wrong* drawing, and it says two things that are not true --
    that the line ends there, and that the gap is blank paper. An enclosed label may no longer step off what it
    covers (:func:`_label_anchors`, ``on_run``), so the fill is what had
    to give.

    Unfilling the shape is not the whole answer, and taking it for the
    whole answer is the defect this docstring used to carry. The plate
    under the words is opaque too, and pinning the label to its run laid
    **thirteen** of the 286 plates across a crossing pipe -- thirteen
    13-unit breaks in lines this drawing says are continuous -- where
    the same corpus lettered bare breaks none at all. So the plate is
    placed to cover nothing but the run it names
    (:func:`stream_numbers`), and where the run offers no such place it
    is **not drawn**: *words* arrives here ``None``, the number is
    written straight onto the sheet, and the line crossing it is drawn
    through it in full. Nine of the 286 land there on this corpus, and
    :func:`label_findings` names each one. A number a passing run
    has to be read across is harder to read; a run with a piece missing
    is not there. Foreign ink erased, at each of the four settings:
    **none** -- and measured off the rendered document rather than off
    :func:`_ink`, which is the only measurement that can catch
    :func:`_ink` being wrong, and did.

    The fill is then the one thing a drawing office does that this does
    not. A white-filled diamond hiding its own run is what they rule,
    and it cannot be ruled here without deleting the neighbour's: the
    fill would have to be clipped to the label's own ink, ``<clipPath>``
    is the only exact way to say that in SVG, and
    :mod:`pandid.render.export` refuses one outright rather than drop it
    silently from the PDF and the PNG. What carries the convention
    without it is that the run is seen to pass *through* the shape
    rather than to stop inside it, which is the grammar the whole

    A second enclosure is not a rectangle, and asking it twice -- each
    shape against the other's bounding box, both ways round -- is not
    the same question and gets the wrong answer: two rhombi can each
    reach into the other's box while neither reaches the other. The
    corpus draws that pair. Two diamonds 222,8 by 26, centres five units
    apart across their runs and overlapping 2,81 along them, and over
    the whole of that overlap the two rhombi between them reach 0,328 --
    they cannot touch, and both directions of the box test call it a
    collision. Over the twenty-one sheets at ``"diamond"`` that test
    names seven crossing pairs where five touch, and bounding box
    against bounding box names twelve. A list the author is asked to
    work from earns nothing by being generous, so this settles it
    exactly. ``tests/test_stream_label_enclosure.py`` keeps that pair of
    rectangles as literals, and checks every pair on the corpus against
    a clipped polygon area.

    Each shape is its own answer. Two boxes are two rectangles and
    :func:`_meets` has already decided. Two circles meet when their
    centres are closer than the two radii. Two rhombi are convex
    polygons, so the separating-axis theorem is exact over the edge
    normals of both: a rhombus of half-diagonals ``a`` by ``b`` has two
    distinct edge normals, ``(b, a)`` and ``(b, -a)``, and its own
    extent about its centre along any axis ``u`` is
    ``max(|a*ux|, |b*uy|)`` -- the four vertices being the only

    it being drawn here was that the fill is opaque over *everything*,
    not only over the run it belongs to, and a diamond is large: filled
    blindly on the corpus as it stood, one would have taken 1154 square
    units of somebody else's ink out of 26 places. Deleting a neighbour's

    of the sheet than the drawing actually puts ink on. Reading the fill

    An enclosed label may not leave its run (#480), so where the shape
    is bigger than the paper beside the line the sheet draws it there
    anyway and something ends up underneath. **That is the decision, and
    this is the list it owes the author**: spacing the plant is a
    drafting choice and belongs to the drafter, but they cannot make it
    from a sheet they have to scan diamond by diamond.

    Three codes, because the three are not the same news:

    * ``enclosure-over-unit`` -- the shape crosses a symbol's box. This
      is the case the decision accepted outright, and the finding is a
      cue and not a complaint: the drawing is crowded and complete.
    * ``enclosure-over-line`` -- the shape crosses ink belonging to some
      other run. Worse to read, because a shape whose grammar is *the
      run passes through me* now has two runs through it.
    * ``enclosure-over-label`` -- two enclosures cross each other,
      which on the shipped corpus is five pairs out of 286 diamonds.
      Reported once per pair, from the second of the two: the first was
      seeded as occupied before the second was placed
      (:func:`stream_numbers`), so the search preferred every clear
      alternative it had and this is what was left. Settled by
      :func:`_shapes_meet`, which is exact: this used to ask the
      shape-against-rectangle test both ways round, which names seven
      pairs here and is wrong about two of them.

    **All three are warnings, and that is a consequence of what the
    drawing does rather than a judgement about crowding.** A sheet that
    shows a connected pipe as broken is a wrong drawing, and a render
    that emits one should refuse rather than warn about it. Nothing
    here emits one: the shape is an outline, and the plate under the
    number is laid only where it covers nothing but the run it names
    (:func:`_enclosure_svg`). What is left over is a crowded drawing
    the author can read, and crowding is what #480 handed to the
    drafter. Give the shape a fill, or let the plate cover a foreign
    run again, and this severity has to rise with it.

    Where the plate had to be dropped -- nine labels of the 286 on the
    corpus with a shape ruled, the runs too short to hold it clear
    anywhere -- ``label-over-line`` says so, and says which runs the
    number is written across. It is a separate code from
    ``enclosure-over-line`` because it is a separate fact: one is a
    shape with two runs through it, the other is a *number* with a run
    through it, and a reader who has to space the sheet needs to know
    which they have.

    ``label-over-line`` is the fourth, and it is the one that has
    nothing to do with enclosures: it fires **at every setting**, the
    default included. A label gives its plate up rather than paint out a
    run that is not its own, and that rule is not conditional on the
    option -- so neither is the finding, or the sheet nobody opted into
    would quietly drop a plate and say nothing. Bare labels reach it
    only on a crowded sheet, since a bare label may still step off what
    it would cover and on the shipped corpus always finds paper; the
    twenty-seven-stream fixture in
    ``tests/test_stream_label_enclosure.py`` is what a sheet with no
    clear paper in any of the fourteen bands beside a run looks like.

    The other three are silent at ``"none"`` for the reason they are
    named after: there is no enclosure to have been drawn over
    anything.

    **No standard on disk settles this, and this docstring is not going

    part of the reference the rest of this module cites -- zero
    occurrences in ISO 15519-1:2010 and zero in ISO 15519-2:2015.
    ISO 15519-1 §12.4 is headed *Joints* and is not about pipe joints at
    all: it governs the joining of *connecting lines* on the paper, and
    marks a join with symbol 501, *Joint of connections*, a dot. Its last
    sentence lets that dot be left off a T-joint, and that is the
    permission this package takes. Nothing here draws a joining
    dot: a tee is two straight strokes and no ``<circle>`` is emitted
    anywhere (see the tee's own artwork in
    :mod:`pandid.render.symbols`). That is conforming, but it is
    conforming by the exemption rather than by the rule.
    ISO 15519-2 §6.3.1 hands symbols to the ISO 14617 series, where the
    flanged-connection symbol lives, but 14617 is a registry of symbols
    rather than a rule about where to put them and is not in
    ``professional_examples/``, so nothing is quoted from it.

    So: **no clause requires a flange at a valve and no clause forbids
    one.** What follows is a drafting choice, and is offered as a choice
    for that reason rather than settled on the author's behalf.

    Two kinds of end are not joints under either setting:

    * a boundary flag, a ``Feed`` or ``Product`` being a reference to
      another sheet, and a reference has no flange faces;
    * an instrument, since what a balloon terminates is a tap or a
      signal, and :func:`flange_marks` has dropped the signal lines.

    Everything else turns on ``want``:

    ``"flanged"``
        Every equipment nozzle, **and both sides of every body standing
        in the run** (:data:`_INLINE_BODIES`). A valve in flanged
        service is flanged both sides, which is how it is got out of the
        line. Reducers and tees stay unmarked, being welded fittings.

    ``"flanged-at-nozzles"``
        The nozzles only, which is what ``P&ID_301.pdf`` draws: every
        piped branch off a shell carries the mark there and nothing else
        on the sheet does, not the gate valves either side of CV-305,
        not the drains, not the boundary flags. On that sheet the mark
        means *this branch is bolted to the vessel* and says nothing
        about the valve downstream. Evidence of what one drawing office

# constructs can, and the first is not available here:
#
# - ``vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"`` says it directly and browsers
#   honour it. **svglib has no notion of the property** (grep it), so
#   the PDF/PNG backend strokes the scaled geometry and drops the
#   attribute without a word, and ``export._reject_unsupported`` does
#   not catch it because an attribute it has never been taught is one it
#   does not look for. Measured through ``export.to_png`` on a rule
#   stretched 3:1, the raster is byte-identical with the attribute and

    is not a cooler drawn the other way round: it is the heater, drawn

    the *nozzles* on the other side -- ``examples/10_ethanol_pfd`` flips
    one to put the condenser's shell inlet underneath, so the overhead
    rises into it dead straight -- and the ports move under the

        Parameters
        ----------
        fs : Flowsheet
            The flowsheet to render.
        jump_direction : str
            Which of two crossing lines carries the crossing mark:
            ``"vertical"`` or ``"horizontal"``.
        crossing_style : str
            What that mark is: ``"arc"`` (the default), ``"gap"`` or
            ``"plain"``. See :data:`CROSSING_STYLES`. Any other spelling
            raises rather than being folded to the default.
        show_stream_table : bool | str
            ``True`` docks the stream property table at the foot of the
            diagram; ``"sheet"`` draws the table as a sheet of its own
            and no diagram at all. See :func:`wants_table_sheet`.
        border : str | None
            ``"none"`` for a plain sheet edge, ``"zone"`` for the
            zone-ruled drawing frame, lettered A.. top down and numbered
            1.. left to right. The flowsheet's title block and
            annotation boxes are drawn whichever is chosen. A table
            sheet rules the zone frame unless told otherwise: it is a
            drawing in its own right rather than a table on paper.
        diagram : str | None
            Which drawing this is: ``"pfd"`` (the default), ``"p&id"``,
            also spelled ``"pid"``, or ``"bfd"``. A P&ID draws its
            process lines without arrowheads; the other two head
            theirs.
        page_size : str | None
            Standard paper size (``"A4"`` through ``"A0"``), drawn at
            exactly that size, with the furniture docked to the sheet
            edges and the drawing fitted into what they leave. ``None``
            (the default) sizes the sheet to the drawing instead.
        connections : str | None
            The joint a P&ID marks on a stream that does not say its own
            (``"flanged"`` or ``"none"``), or ``None`` to mark nothing a
            stream has not stated. Ignored outside a P&ID, since a PFD's
            symbols are only ever general ones. See
            :func:`sheet_connections`.
        debug : bool | float
            Draw the coordinate overlay under the diagram: a ruled grid
            carrying its own coordinates, every unit's ``pin()`` anchor
            and every port. ``True`` rules it at the default spacing and
            a number sets that spacing. Off by default. See

        it, the impulse line from a tap on that line to the balloon
        reading it, and the balloon itself. The tag is drawn last of
        everything, on an opaque halo, so it wins against all three --
        and what it wins is a hole in somebody else's drawing.

        *symbols* is every other unit's box, because a free face is not
        free paper: a nozzle is the only thing layout can see, and a
        balloon parked just off the face is invisible to it. Both halos

        least damaging wins, by :func:`_erases`, and a tie keeps the
        earlier answer.

        *normal open*, set **above the symbol and to the right**, and
        illustrates that at Figure 28. The figure draws it on an unfilled
        bowtie with the letters starting at about the valve's right-hand
        edge, clear above the run.

        The corner is fixed, not chosen from the valve's quarter turn:
        reading the marking always in the same place is what lets
        someone scan a sheet for closed valves, and the upper right is
        the corner an equipment tag is least likely to be in, the
        default tag sitting centred *above*.

        This departs from PIP PIC001 4.2.2.8, which puts the letters
        below a horizontal valve and to the right of a vertical one, and
        which is where the darkened body of 4.2.2.7 still comes from.
        The two are taken from different sources on purpose: PIP is the

        own Method A stem arrows. See

        horizontal line, and 0.06 inch to its right on a vertical one.

        So the quarter turn moves these letters where it does not move
        the ``NC`` abbreviation (:meth:`_nc_label_item`), and the two
        are not inconsistent. ``NC`` sits in a *corner*, and a corner is
        free whichever way a valve is laid. These letters sit against a
        *face*, and which face is free is exactly what the quarter turn
        changes: the face below a valve on a horizontal run is clear,
        and the face below the same valve on a riser is its outlet
        nozzle with the line running out of it.

        Where the equipment tag is already on the side the letters want
        -- which the engine does choose for a valve on a riser -- the
        letters step past it along that same side rather than over it,
        both being drawn on opaque halos in the same final pass.
        ``tag_box`` is where that tag actually landed (see
        :meth:`_tag_item`), resolved from the frame when a caller has
        not already done so.

        A tag is not the only thing on that face, and treating it as
        though it were is issue #223: the letters then step *out* past
        the tag and land on the impulse line joining the valve to the
        trip square hung below it. So the ink and the neighbouring
        symbols are asked too, by :func:`_step_aside`, which slides the
        mark **along** the face -- the one direction that gets it off a
        line leaving that same face -- and holds it to half the face so
        PIP's *directly below* survives the move. ``ink`` and
        ``symbols`` are the sheet's, in the two forms :meth:`_tag_item`
        takes them; a mark placed with neither still steps past its tag.

        The two moves compose in the order the sheet has them: out past
        the tag first, that one being settled by a box the mark cannot
        share at all, then sideways off whatever the outward step landed
        on. The tag goes into the sideways pass's obstacles as well, so
        the slide cannot walk back onto what the step just cleared.

        This does not extend to ``NC``, for the reason
        :meth:`_nc_label_item` already rests on: a corner has nowhere to
        slide to that is still the corner.

        ``crossing_style`` is the mark a crossing of two unconnected
        runs carries and ``jump_direction`` is which of the two carries
        it; see :data:`CROSSING_STYLES`. All three are the same two path
        commands over the same ``2 * HOP_R`` of run -- the arc sweeps
        across it, the interruption lifts the pen over it, and
        ``"plain"`` writes neither and leaves the ``L`` that was going
        to be written anyway. So a crossing has the room for one exactly
        when it has the room for the others, and
        :func:`unmarked_crossings` needs no third answer.

        **Where the numbers go does not follow the style.** :func:`_ink`
        reserves a :func:`hop_box` for every crossing whichever mark the
        sheet draws, so a sheet redrawn in another convention keeps its
        line numbers exactly where the arc left them. On ``"gap"`` and
        ``"plain"`` that reserves the semicircle's paper for a mark that
        does not cover it -- reserving paper that is clear, which is the
        direction :func:`hop_box` already says it prefers to err in, and
        the alternative is a change of convention that also moves every
        number near a crossing.

        ``joints`` is the sheet's :func:`sheet_connections` answer --
        the joint every line takes unless it says otherwise, or ``None``
        on a drawing that marks no joints at all.

        ``plates`` is an out-parameter, filled -- when a caller supplies
        a list -- with every opaque white rectangle this pass and the
        equipment-tag pass between them put on the sheet. Only the
        debugging overlay asks for it, and it asks because it is drawn
        *underneath* all of them: see
        :func:`pandid.render.debug.overlay`. Left ``None`` nothing is
        collected and nothing about the render changes.

        The lines and symbols a number has to dodge are
