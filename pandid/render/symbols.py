"""SVG symbol registry for the topology primitives.

Equipment shapes follow the conventions of ISO 10628-2 and instrument
balloons follow ANSI/ISA-5.1. Neither set is certified conformant to
anything, and the stencil library the equipment comes from makes no
standards claim of its own. Sources:

- **Vendored (draw.io / diagrams.net P&ID stencils, Apache-2.0)**:
  valves and their variants, pumps, compressors, blowers, coolers,
  heaters, heat exchangers, cooling towers, vessels, columns, reactors,
  separators, tanks, dryers, filters, furnaces, thickeners, turbines,
  reducers, in-line fittings, ejectors, vents and funnels. Converted
  from mxGraph stencil XML by ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py`` into
  ``_vendored_symbols.py`` and registered last (overriding the
  hand-drawn defaults of the same kind). See the repo ``NOTICE`` for
  attribution.
- **Hand-drawn primitives**: Feed/Product boundary markers, the
  variable-port Mixer and Splitter, the pipe tee, and the block flow
  diagram's box.
- **Built to size (draw.io-derived, Apache-2.0)**: the belt conveyor.
  Adapted from a stencil but drawn here rather than generated, because a
  fixed path cannot stretch; see :func:`conveyor_symbol` and the repo
  ``NOTICE``.
- **Built to fit (original)**: the block flow diagram's box, whose
  nozzles are a per-face count the symbol cannot know until it has the
  unit, and whose box is sized to hold them; see :func:`block_symbol`.

Authoring conventions (hand-drawn symbols)
------------------------------------------
- Local coordinates: (0, 0) top-left, spanning ``width`` × ``height``.
- Ports: named anchors on the boundary face a stream attaches to; names
  MUST match the owning :class:`~pandid.units.Unit`'s port names.
- Variants share a ``kind`` and register under a ``variant`` name.
- A symbol whose shape carries meaning sets ``stretchable=False`` and is
  centred in a box of another shape rather than distorted to fill it. A
  balloon is a circle because ISA-5.1 says a circle.

Composed symbols
----------------
Every symbol above is drawn whole. ISO 10628-2 also builds symbols out
of a body and the *parts* of its subject groups 26-29, and clause 5
makes doing so a ``shall`` for anything it does not tabulate:
:class:`IsoPart`, :class:`Overlay`, :class:`OverlayPart` and
:func:`compose` are that mechanism. Read the comment block above
:class:`IsoPart` before composing anything -- it says when a drawing may
be composed at all, which is a narrower question than it looks.

    long.

    The library's one rule for spacing a family of like nozzles down a
    face, so a mixer's inlets, a column's feeds and a block's
    connections are all spread the same way and the drawing is
    consistent between them.

    Members sit ``pitch`` apart, centred on ``at`` (the middle of the
    band when it is ``None``). Past the point where that spacing would
    run them off the ends the whole run is squeezed into ``extent`` of
    the face instead, so the count a symbol was drawn for lands exactly
    where a fixed nozzle would and one more does not shove the others
    aside to find room.

    ``align`` is :data:`CENTRED` or :data:`FROM_START` and decides which
    of those two the run is anchored by. Either way ``at`` is where a
    lone member goes, so a symbol keeps the nozzle it was drawn with;
    the difference is only which way a second one pushes.

    ``band`` is the stretch of face a member may be drawn on, ``(lo,
    hi)`` in the same coordinate ``at`` is measured in, and defaults to
    the whole face. **It is an outer limit**: the run is first squeezed
    to fit inside it and then slid, by the least it can, until it is
    inside it. So no member this returns is ever outside the band, at
    any count, for any ``at``, any ``pitch``, either ``align`` and any
    face length.

    An outer limit and not usually the *binding* one. The span taken is
    ``min(pitch * (count - 1), extent * along, hi - lo)``, and which of
    the three wins is per symbol and per count: across the shipped
    holdup bodies the band is tighter on thirty of the thirty-six walled
    faces at the widest count and ``extent`` on the other six. What the
    band adds is the part ``extent`` cannot state -- ``extent`` bounds
    the run's *length* and never says where that length is laid down, so
    a run centred on a nozzle drawn near the end of its wall walks
    straight off the body however short it is. A tank fills low on its
    shell, and the third inlet of ``21_alumina_refinery``'s M-901 was
    8,9 units below the bottom of the tank (#488).

    Sliding rather than re-centring is what keeps the drawing the symbol
    asked for: a family whose band has room stays exactly where ``at``
    and ``align`` put it, and only one that has run out of wall is
    moved, by exactly the overhang and no more.

    A band of **no length** contains everything and places nothing: every
    member lands on the one coordinate it allows. That is a face with no
    wall on it -- a dome crown, a cone apex, a dished head -- and it is
    refused rather than drawn; see :func:`bandless_face`.

    :class:`PortSeries` is the declarative form of this, for a symbol
    that can name its family with one rule. :func:`block_symbol` calls
    it directly, because a block's family is split across up to four
    faces and one series cannot span two of them; see

#

# symbol wanted is not tabulated, and ISO 14617-1:2025 §4.7 with Annex B
# restates it with a worked six-part example. The standard demonstrates
# it on itself: item 8.6 (electrostatic precipitator, X8125) is the
# group-8 body carrying item 29.2 (C2030), item 8.8 (electromagnetic
# separator, X8126) is the same body carrying item 29.3 (C2031), and
# item 8.7 (wet electrostatic precipitator, X8033) is that body carrying
# **two** parts at once.
#
# THE RULE THIS MODULE ENFORCES, AND THE ONE TO READ BEFORE ADDING A
# COMPOSITION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Compose only where ISO itself composes. Where ISO registers a
# distinct symbol, it stays a distinct symbol.**
#
# The test is not "does it look like a body with something inside it".
# It is: *is every mark that distinguishes this drawing from the shared
# body a tabulated group-26/27/28/29 item, and can it be named by its
# registration number?* Item 8.3 (gravity separator, X8031) passes -- its
# only mark is the down arrow that Table 2 registers on its own as item
# 29.1, C2028. Item 8.10 (cyclone separator, X2618) fails: its mark is a
# helical vortex, and no item in group 29 draws one, so there is nothing
# to compose it from and X2618 is its own registered symbol. A
# hydrocyclone is not "separator body + cyclone characteristic"; it is
# X2618.
#
# The rule reads "compose only where ISO itself composes", and the two
# halves are not the same test. Nearly always the part is a group-26/29
# item and the two coincide. Once, they do not: item 1.27 (X8006) draws
# the general electric **motor** -- item 20.6, and group 20 is DRIVES,
# whole machines -- above a stirred vessel, on the stirrer's own shaft,
# and registers the result. So a mark can be a tabulated apparatus and
# still be composed, because ISO composed it. That admission is
# :data:`COMPOSED_APPARATUS`, and it lists *items* precisely so it cannot
# become a licence for the group they come from.
#
# :class:`IsoPart` is where that test is made checkable rather than
# remembered. A part cannot be registered without naming the group, the
# item number and the registration number it claims to be, so a reader
# -- or ``tests/test_composition.py`` -- can put the drawing next to
# Table 2 and check it. Registration numbers are the identity of a
# symbol (ISO 14617-1 §3.6) and are what tells two same-shape symbols
# apart (§4.2), which is exactly the distinction this rule turns on.

class Overlay:
    """One supplementary part, and where it sits on a body's box.

    Named rather than held: an overlay carries the part's registry key,
    so the artwork and the registration number are looked up in the one
    place they are declared, and an overlay is a small hashable value the
    composition cache can be keyed by.

    The placement is stated in **fractions of the body's box**, not in
    drawing units, which is what makes a composition survive being
    resized. A tray at ``y=0.3`` is three-tenths down the shell whether
    the shell is drawn at its own size or stretched to a box the author
    gave the unit, so the trays stay evenly spaced instead of drifting
    off the bottom head.

    Fractions outside ``0..1`` put the part outside the body, and that is
    a supported case rather than an accident: ISO item 1.27 (X8006) hangs
    the drive motor **above** the top head, on the agitator's shaft.
    :func:`compose` grows the composed box to hold it.

    A part that repeats -- a tray column is one deck drawn N times -- is
    N overlays with N values of ``y``, not one overlay with a count. The
    pitch is then the caller's arithmetic and the mechanism stays a
    placement rule, which is what lets a baffle-tray column alternate
    which wall each deck touches by varying ``x`` as well.

    Args:
        group: The part's ISO subject group: 26 to 29, or 20 for the one
            drive :data:`COMPOSED_APPARATUS` admits.
        name: The part's registry name, in pandid's spelling
            (``"turbine"``), not the standard's descriptor.
        x: Left edge, as a fraction of the body's width.
        y: Top edge, as a fraction of the body's height.
        w: Width, as a fraction of the body's width.

    ----------------------------------------
    Two of Table 2's four group-26 supports are **chiral**: the standard
    draws item 26.2's bracket and item 26.4's ring against a wall on one
    side, and a vessel standing on either wants a pair, one per wall. The
    parts are drawn in the hand Table 2 draws them in, so the other hand
    has to come from somewhere, and a placement flag is the cheaper of
    the two answers -- a second registered part would be a *second
    registration number* for a symbol the standard numbers once, which is
    exactly the false identity :class:`IsoPart` exists to stop.

    Left to right only, because that is the whole of the case. A support
    turned upside down is not a support, and a mark that means something
    different upside down is what :attr:`OverlayPart.directional` is for.

# identical zigzag turns on that line, each 4 M wide and reaching 2 M
# either side of it -- and re-drawn here on pandid's own grid.
#
# Built to its length rather than scaled to it, which is the belt
# conveyor's rule above and is here for a different reason. A belt is
# made to measure because its rollers are circles and uneven scaling
# turns them into ellipses. A screw has no circle in it; what a stretch
# would ruin is the *pitch*, since a 30-unit screw and a 300-unit screw
# scaled from one drawing would show the same two turns, and the second
# would read as a screw with a flight every four metres. So the turns
# keep their size and a longer casing gets more of them, which is what
# the standard's own repeating construction means.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

      turns as an 80-unit one reads as a flight every four metres.
    - *Across it* -- the axis and the flight's reach -- follows the

# Its nozzles cannot be authored in advance. A Mixer's are a PortSeries:
# one rule, one face, spread by count. A block's connections are split
# across up to four faces with a count on each, so one series cannot
# place them and the symbol has to be built once the unit is in hand --
# the conveyor's mechanism above, for a different reason. That is also
# what lets the box size itself to what it carries.

#: closer than about two and a half heads apart draw two arrows whose

#: blob rather than as two lines arriving. That is the defect reported
#: against ``10_ethanol_pfd``'s M-301, whose two feeds are 14.5 apart

#: them.

    ``_faces`` holds only the two families: ``vent``, ``relief`` and
    ``drain`` are carried over from the vendored symbol untouched, menu
    included.

    ``overlays`` is the unit's own :attr:`~pandid.units.Unit.overlays`
    (empty unless it composes one, which today only :class:`Vessel`'s
    ``supports=`` does). Composed *before* the family is recomputed,
    through :meth:`SymbolRegistry.composed` -- the vendored base and
    not this function's own cache, so a leg or a skirt is drawn under
    the shell exactly as it is for every other composed unit, and this
    is only ever laying the two families on top of it. Registering
    ``("tank", None)``/``("vessel", None)`` in :data:`_BUILT_TO_SIZE`
    means :meth:`SymbolRegistry.for_unit` reaches this function
    *before* its own overlay branch ever runs, so skipping this would
    silently draw every supported vessel bare.

    **Squeezed, not grown.** A block's box means nothing, so
    :func:`block_symbol` grows it to hold a family at full pitch; a tank
    or vessel's artwork is vendored and its size means something, so
    this takes :func:`spread`'s **squeeze** instead -- the fallback a
    mixer's own inlets already reach for when a face runs out of room,
    taken here on purpose. One member alone is never squeezed
    (:func:`spread` returns ``at`` exactly), so a plain single inlet and
    single outlet land on precisely the coordinate the vendored artwork
    always anchored, and nothing drawn at that count moves.

    **Confined to the wall the artwork drew.** The run is bounded by
    :attr:`Symbol.bands`' entry for the face, which is the stretch of it
    that is shell rather than roof, floor or head. Without it the family
    was centred on ``t0`` and bounded by nothing: ``t0`` is where the
    stencil drew a *single* nozzle and a tank fills low on its shell, so
    a family straddling it hangs half of itself below the floor -- three
    inlets on ``tank/default`` put the third 9,5 units under the bottom
    of the drawing (#488). ``bands`` is the dimension that was missing,
    and it is declared per symbol rather than worked out here from the
    ``svg``.

    **The artwork itself never changes.** Unlike a block's rectangle or
    a conveyor's rollers, a tank's or a vessel's ``svg`` draws no mark at
    a nozzle -- only the vendored outline, the same whichever face a
    connection is on or how many share it. So this leaves

    from, whatever each instance's own connections are.

# with its registration numbers: A.3.20, "Control valve, general,
# continuously adjustability, SHOWN WITH GENERAL ACTUATOR", carries
# three at once -- 2101A, 210A, P050B -- because the control valve
# symbol *is* the body symbol with an actuator symbol on it. §7.4.4.3
# completes the rule: an actuator is drawn with an actuator symbol that
# says nothing about its type or its power medium, and a symbol for a
# specific type is used only where the reader needs one to understand
# the diagram.
#
# So the API takes the two questions separately -- ``variant`` is the
# body, ``actuator`` is what strokes it. The artwork cannot follow it.
#
# The stencil set FUSES the two. Every actuated valve draw.io ships is
# one path drawing a body and an operator together: "Pneumatic Operated"
# is the bowtie with a dome on it, "Motor Operated Valve" the same
# bowtie with a lettered box, and so on through the whole of valves.xml
# (32 shapes; the six below are all of them that draw an operator at
# all). There is no separate actuator glyph to lay over a globe or a
# ball, so a globe body with a diaphragm actuator is not a combination
# this package can draw -- not because the API forbids it, but because
# no drawing of it exists. A synthesised one would have no
# ``drawio_shape``, so an export to draw.io would hand the reader a
# traced picture where every other valve is a native editable stencil.
#
# This table is therefore the pairs the stencil set can draw, keyed the
# way an engineer asks for them. A pair that is not here raises and
# names the ones that are: reject rather than repair, because a silently
# substituted drawing says something the author did not.
#
# ``default`` and ``gate`` are both keyed because they are byte-for-byte
# the same stencil (draw.io's "Gate Valve"), and it is ISO's *general*
# two-way body rather than specifically a gate: A.3.20 builds the
# control valve on exactly it.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

#:
#: Read by :class:`pandid.units.Valve`, which resolves the pair to a

#:
#: - A **hand-operated** valve has an operator but no actuator.
#:   ``manual`` draws a handwheel and ``knife`` a rising stem through
#:   one; a handwheel loses no air.
#: - A **self-acting** valve is powered by the process it sits in.
#:   ``regulator`` works off its own dome and ``relief`` and ``psv`` off
#:   a spring against line pressure, so there is no supply whose failure
#:   is the question.
#: - A **bare body** -- ``gate``, ``globe``, ``ball``, ``butterfly`` and
#:   the rest -- is drawn with no operator at all.
#:
#: Every entry is a pairing out of :data:`ACTUATED`, which is the whole
#: of the rule: a valve declares a fail position when the drawing puts a
#: powered actuator on it. ``manual`` is the one pairing left out,
#: because a handwheel is an operator and not an actuator.
#:
#: Every variant here is a two-port body. PIP PIC001 4.5.3.2(2) rules
#: multi-port valves out of the letters -- an automated multi-port
#: valve takes ``FL`` or ``FI`` where those fit, and not ``FO`` or
#: ``FC``, whose job is done instead by arrows drawing the fail-position
#: flow paths -- and this package draws no such
#: arrows. ``three_way`` is a bare body with no operator, so the
#: question does not arise today; an actuated multi-port variant added
#: later must not simply be added to this set.

class OverlayPart:
    """One supplementary symbol's artwork, and the ISO item it is.

    A part is *only* combinable, never standalone: that is what makes it
    a supplementary symbol under ISO 14617-1 §3.3 rather than a basic one
    under §3.2. It is drawn in its own ``width`` x ``height`` box, with
    (0, 0) at the top-left exactly as a :class:`Symbol` is, and
    :func:`compose` maps that box onto whatever rectangle of the body's
    an :class:`Overlay` names.

    Args:
        name: pandid's spelling, and half the registry key --
            ``"turbine"``, where the standard says "Agitator, turbine
            type". Short, because it is what an author types.
        iso: The Table 2 row this drawing claims to be. Required; see
            :class:`IsoPart`.
        svg: A single ``<g>`` group, like a :class:`Symbol`'s. The
            wrapper is dropped when the part is painted onto a body, so
            its id is never emitted and only its contents are.
        width: The box the artwork is drawn in.
        height: The box the artwork is drawn in.
        ports: Connections the *part* brings with it, in the part's own
            coordinates. Almost always empty; see below.
        stretchable: May the artwork be scaled unevenly to fill the
            rectangle it is placed on? The same question
            :attr:`Symbol.stretchable` asks, with the same answer: a tray
            deck is a line and may be any length, an impeller and a
            manhole are shapes and may not be squashed. A part that says
            no is scaled evenly and centred on its rectangle, and it
            makes the whole composition unstretchable -- see
            :func:`compose`.
        gravity_fixed: Does this part state that gravity does the work?
            ISO 14617-1 §4.5 forbids turning a symbol where gravity is a
            functionality, and item 29.1 (C2028, the settling arrow) is
            that statement made as a part: a body carrying it must not be
            turned even when the bare body may be.
        directional: Does the artwork state a direction an axis flip
            would reverse? Same question :attr:`Symbol.directional` asks.
            The settling arrow is the case again -- flipped, it says the
            heavy phase rises.
        drawio_shape: The draw.io stencil that draws this part on its
            own, where one exists (the stencil set ships ``Prop
            Agitator`` and ``Turbine Agitator`` as exactly this kind of
            drop-on overlay). Empty where the part has to be exported as
            geometry.

    Ports: what a part does and does not contribute
    ----------------------------------------------
    **An agitator brings a connection; an internal and a characteristic
    do not.** That is not a convenience, it is what the standard draws.
    ISO item 1.27 (X8006, "jacketed vessel with dished ends and agitator
    driven by electric motor") draws the stirrer's shaft running up
    through the top head to a circle marked ``M`` sitting *above* the
    vessel -- itself item 20.6, C0082, "electric motor (general)". The
    drive is a real connection at a real place on the drawing, so the
    part that draws it anchors a nozzle there. A tray (group 27) and a
    characteristic (group 29) are marks inside a body that no line ever
    reaches, and they anchor nothing.

    A part's ports are **added** to the body's, never substituted for
    them: :func:`compose` refuses a part whose nozzle name the body

    already ordinary here -- the anchor is simply never asked for -- so a
    body composed with an agitator draws the drive and a
    :class:`~pandid.units.Unit` that has no ``drive`` in its ``PORTS``
    connects nothing to it. The unit half is the other side of the same
    change and is declared where every other nozzle is: in ``PORTS``, or
    in a ``_VARIANT_PORTS`` table for a nozzle only some variants have.

    One :class:`Symbol` out, so nothing downstream learns a second kind
    of drawing: a composition is placed, resized, mirrored, exported and
    cached exactly as a whole symbol is, and the renderer never asks
    whether it was composed. That is the same choice :func:`darkened` and
    :func:`expander` make, for the same reason -- the ``<defs>`` entry a
    ``<use>`` points at is keyed by the artwork, so a body with parts and
    the bare body are two drawings and need two definitions.

    Each part is mapped from its own box onto the rectangle of the body's
    box its :class:`Overlay` names. Because the rectangle is stated as
    *fractions*, the mapping is re-done nowhere: the placement is already
    proportional, so stretching the finished symbol into a unit's box
    carries the parts with the body and a tray three-tenths down the
    shell stays three-tenths down it.

    What the parts decide about the whole
    -------------------------------------
    - **Stretchable** only if the body and every part is. A part that may
      not be reshaped is scaled evenly and centred on its own rectangle
      here, which handles the composition at its own size -- but the
      renderer stretches the *finished* symbol as one drawing, and there
      is no way to hold one group still inside a group that is being
      stretched. Refusing the stretch for the whole symbol is the only
      answer that keeps an impeller round, and it costs the body nothing
      it was entitled to: ISO 14617-1 §4.4 bounds reshaping at the
      point where the symbol stops being recognisable, and an impeller
      drawn as a smear is exactly that.
    - **Gravity-fixed** and **directional** if the body or any part is.
      Both are statements the artwork makes, and a part makes them as
      readily as a body: item 29.1's settling arrow says the heavy phase
      goes *down*, so a body carrying it may not be turned (ISO 14617-1
      §4.5) and may not be flipped without drawing the opposite claim.

    The box, and parts drawn outside the body
    -----------------------------------------
    The composed box is the union of the body's and every part's. A part
    inside the body leaves it exactly the body's box, which is the common
    case and costs nothing. A part hanging off it grows the box and
    shifts everything into it, which is what ISO item 1.27 (X8006) needs:
    the drive motor is drawn above the top head, so the vessel is no
    longer the whole drawing and the nozzles have to move down with it --
    the fixed ones by ``shift`` below, a :class:`PortSeries` by
    :func:`_shifted_series`, since a series states its placement in
    absolute coordinates along a face that has just got longer.

    A nozzle **on** the body cannot always survive that. A face here is
    the box edge the nozzle is nearest, re-derived from the coordinate
    wherever it is read, so a vent on a vessel's crown is nearest the top
    of the vessel's own box and nearest a *side* of a box grown to hold a
    motor above it: the stream would leave through the shell wall. That
    is refused below rather than drawn, and the answer is to clear the
    crown -- which is what 1.27 draws, a top head carrying nothing but
    the shaft.

    draw.io
    -------
    The composed symbol carries no ``drawio_shape``. A stencil reference
    names *one* shape and draw.io draws whatever that name resolves to,
    so a composed reactor exported under its body's reference would come
    out as a bare vessel -- the right outline, silently missing the thing
    that made it a reactor. Naming nothing is what makes the two backends
    disagree loudly instead of quietly.

    What the exporter reads instead is :attr:`Symbol.overlays` for the
    parts and :attr:`Symbol.drawio_body_shape` for the outline under
    them, and it emits **one cell per part, grouped under the body's**.
    The body's reference is carried across to that second field rather
    than dropped, because it is still true of the body -- and stating it
    under a name that says "body" is what keeps it from being read as a
    statement about the whole drawing.

# trap.
#
# Drawn here rather than vendored, and the refusal is recorded in
# ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py``: the draw.io set's "Steam Trap" is an
# empty 50 x 50 rectangle byte-identical to its own "Desuper Heater", so
# vendoring it would file a blank box under two device names. There is
# nothing in it to quote, which is what STENCIL_PATCHES needs, so the
# mark is new artwork -- a hand-drawn primitive under CONTRIBUTING
# section 1.
#
# NOT a composition in the :class:`Overlay` sense, and the distinction
# is the one :meth:`SymbolRegistry._register_crushing_machines` already
# draws for the crusher's and the mill's marks: an overlay is only ever
# justified by ISO composing at that point, and :class:`IsoPart` demands
# the Table 2 row the part is. The half filled below the diameter here
# appears in no subject group 26-29, so it is not a supplementary symbol
# and there is no registration number for it to carry -- composing from
# one would invent a symbol. It is therefore the body's own mark, drawn
# in named layers below the way group 11's and group 7's marks are.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

        a change to ``separator/scrubber`` rather than a part landing.

        The cost, stated because it is real: the three lose their draw.io
        stencils. Each of the three *is* a stencil in draw.io's P&ID set,
        but the outline underneath them is not, so the exporter draws the
        body as a rectangle with the mark as a child cell rather than as
        the shape draw.io has for the pair. Naming the whole-composition
        stencil here instead would put a ``drawio_shape`` on a composed
        symbol, which is the one thing :func:`compose` refuses -- and the
        refusal is what stops a *body's* reference being reused for a
        body-plus-parts drawing, which is the far commoner and far
        quieter error.

        The group is one trapezoid (:data:`_CRUSHER_OUTLINE`) drawn
        twelve times, and the rows differ in two layers:

        1. **The body's own mark**, which says whether the machine
           crushes or grinds. 11.2 X8085 the crusher draws two full-depth
           verticals, 11.8 X8086 the mill draws two chords across the top
           corners, and 11.1 X8084 the general machine draws neither.
           Neither mark appears anywhere in group 29, so neither is a
           part, and the three bodies are whole registered drawings.
        2. **A group-29 characteristic** inside it, which says *how*. Nine
           of the twelve rows carry one, every one of them already drawn
           in :mod:`pandid.render.iso_parts`, and each is centred on the
           body's box at the size its own group-29 row draws it. So the
           nine are compositions, and closing this group cost three bodies
           rather than twelve drawings.

        Item 11.1 X8084 means "a crusher or a mill, unspecified", which is
        not a thing a *finished* sheet says -- but it is exactly what an
        early PFD says, before process design has picked jaw over cone or
        even settled coarse crushing against fine grinding, and a
        placeholder box with no ISO number of its own is a worse answer
        than the row the standard already gives that stage.
        :class:`~pandid.units.CrushingMachine` is the class that asks for
        it and the base :class:`~pandid.units.Crusher` and
        :class:`~pandid.units.Mill` are built on, so a machine picked later
        is a variant of the same unit rather than a fresh one dropped in
        beside it.

        Item 11.12 X8054 is the one row that is not a body plus a part
        alone: it draws a 4 M drum around 29.14's arrows, and a drum has
        no group-29 number. :data:`_VIBRATION_DRUM` is why the number can
        still be claimed -- see it.

        ISO 10628-2 has no evaporator group, so there is no table to
        close and no row to measure against: what decides the set is
        which machines a process engineer picks between when sizing an
        evaporation duty, and which of those differences the *drawing*
        can carry.

        =================  =============================================
        variant            what tells it from the others
        =================  =============================================
        ``default``        two tubesheets around a plain boxed element:
                           an evaporator whose element is not yet chosen
        ``calandria``      short tubes and a central downcomer
        ``falling_film``   long tubes, fed onto a distributor over them
        ``climbing_film``  the same long tubes, fed into the foot of them
        ``plate``          a plate pack, and so no tubesheets at all
        =================  =============================================

        **``default`` is the general row**, and it is here for the
        reason ISO's own item 11.1 X8084 general crushing machine is:
        "an evaporator, element unspecified" is not a thing a finished
        sheet says, but it is exactly what an early PFD says, and a
        placeholder box is a worse answer than a body that draws only
        what has been decided.

        **Falling and climbing film are one body and two drawings.** The
        machines differ in where the liquor enters and therefore in
        which way the film runs, so the tubes are the same and the feed
        nozzle is not: :data:`_EVAP_FEED_HIGH` against
        :data:`_EVAP_FEED_LOW`. The distributor is the second half of
        it, and it is a real difference rather than a marking -- a
        climbing-film evaporator has none, because its liquor arrives
        under the tubesheet and is carried up by its own vapour.

        **There is no forced-circulation row, and that is a finding
        rather than an omission.** A forced-circulation evaporator is
        drawn on a real sheet as three tagged items -- this body, the
        circulating heater, and the pump between them -- because all
        three are scheduled, sized and maintained separately. Drawing
        the loop into one symbol would put a pump and an exchanger
        inside another apparatus, which is two units on one tag: the
        same objection :data:`COMPOSED_APPARATUS` states, and the same
        answer :class:`~pandid.units.Boiler` gives its burner.

        is a sloping shell on trunnions, a fluidised calciner is an
        upright vessel on a windbox, and a shaft kiln is a column of
        burden. What they share is what makes them one kind -- solids in,
        calcined solids out, spent gas out on a nozzle of its own, and a
        fire of their own to do it with.

        It is registered under that name rather than under ``rotary``
        with an alias, so ``Kiln("K-101")`` draws a machine rather than
        a placeholder and there is one drawing under one key.

        All three are gravity-fixed, and each for its own reason. The
        rotary shell **falls** from feed to discharge and turned over it
        climbs; the calciner's bed rests on its grid and its freeboard is
        above it; the shaft kiln is charged over the top and discharged
        out of the bottom. Every one of them is ISO 15519-1 11.4.2's
