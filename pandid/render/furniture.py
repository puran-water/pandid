"""Sheet furniture: the engineering title strip, generic titled boxes,
generic tables, the stream property table, and the zone-ruled drawing
border.

Every routine here is a pure function returning a list of SVG-fragment
strings (or a ``(width, height)`` measurement). The renderer in
:mod:`pandid.render.svg` measures each piece, places it at a sheet
corner, unions the result to size the canvas, then draws it; none of the
geometry logic lives in the giant render method.

:func:`dock` is the placement itself, and it is *not* SVG: it takes
measured boxes and answers the rectangle the sheet gives each one. It
lives here rather than inside the renderer because two backends now ask
the question. See its docstring.

Coordinates are absolute SVG user units. Boxes are drawn from a top-left
origin; the title strip is drawn from a bottom-right corner (its natural
anchor).

    per-character width rules measure a string by, so a CJK tag and a
    combining mark are never charged the Latin rate the rest of the
    sheet's lettering is charged at.

    :func:`text_width` no longer needs the narrow count: Latin-1 has a
    real advance per character now, and this answers only for what the
    face does not encode. The equipment-tag halo
    (:func:`pandid.render.svg._unit_label_box`) and a labelled block's
    own box (:func:`pandid.render.symbols.label_span`) still measure
    through here, at per-character rates of their own.

    :func:`unicodedata.east_asian_width` sorts a codepoint into five
    classes. *W*ide and *F*ullwidth -- CJK ideographs, fullwidth forms --
    draw close to a full em, same as the font's own point size. *H*alfwidth
    and *Na*rrow -- Latin letters, digits, halfwidth kana -- draw at the
    per-character rate its caller was tuned to (see :func:`text_width`
    and ``_ADV``). *A*mbiguous -- Greek, Cyrillic, most
    symbols, a character that is narrow set among Latin and wide set
    among CJK -- has no surrounding text here to decide it by, so it
    takes the standard's own default for that case (UAX #11, East Asian
    Width, section "Recommendations"): "In the absence of context,
    Ambiguous characters should be treated as Narrow." This renderer
    never knows whether a string sits in a CJK line or a Latin one, so
    the no-context default is the only defensible reading, and it is
    also the one that leaves every shipped, Latin-tagged sheet exactly
    where it was.

    A combining mark -- general category ``Mn`` (nonspacing) or ``Me``
    (enclosing) -- draws on top of the glyph before it rather than
    beside it, so it advances nothing of its own. Charged a full
    narrow glyph, it is the same bug this function exists to fix, just

    bold), which is near enough the mean of Helvetica's ASCII to look
    calibrated and is wrong by a third on either side of it for real
    drawing text. ``STREAM NUMBER`` came out 17 per cent narrow,
    ``PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM`` 14, ``Pump`` 14, ``iiii`` 150 per cent
    wide; a section heading of capitals ran through and out of the rules
    of the cell that had been ruled to hold it. The error was known and
    absorbed rather than fixed -- ``_CELL_PAD`` in
    :mod:`pandid.render.drawio` is fat by exactly the eleven per cent
    that mean under-charges ``HPSSH`` by, and says so.

    It matters more than a fat pad because a width here is not only how

    the page* and refuses the render when it does not

    **Where to cut is measured, and measured the way the width is.**

    Two bugs met here, one from each side, and they have one answer. The
    cut used to be ``int(room / (size * adv)) - 1`` characters -- how
    many would fit if every character were the average one -- which is a
    count and not a width, so it cut a line of capitals too late and a
    line of narrow letters far too early, and left the ellipsis it then
    appended unpaid for. And because the *decision* to cut was
    :func:`text_width`'s while the cut itself counted at the Latin rate,
    the two disagreed by the ratio between those rates: a fullwidth
    title kept 28 characters measuring 290 units for a 187-unit cell and
    was drawn straight through the sheet count beside it, on every page
    size.

    There is no closed form left to invert -- a character's advance is
    its own now (:data:`_ADVANCE`) rather than one rate for the whole
    alphabet -- so the string is grown a character at a time against
    :func:`text_width` itself, with the ellipsis charged for first. Both
    ends are the same function rather than two readings of one rate, and
    the prefix this keeps is a prefix ``text_width`` agrees fits.

    The earlier objection to walking -- that summing per-character
    widths lands a rounding away from the same characters measured
    whole, which is :func:`_total`'s complaint pointed at another pair
    of numbers -- does not arise, because nothing is summed in floats.
    ``text_width`` adds integer thousandths and scales once at the end,
    so a prefix and the whole string are added the same way and cannot
    disagree in the last bit.

    **Measured on the width the blocks are actually ruled at**, which is
    the whole of this function's reason for being separate. A block is
    as wide as its stream columns *plus the label column*, and the label
    column is widened to carry a section heading across the narrowest
    block (:func:`_section_span`) -- so the width cannot be known until
    the partition is chosen, and a capacity worked out before the
    widening is a capacity the finished table can exceed.

    That is not hypothetical: twenty-one streams under a long section
    heading were cut 11/10 from a capacity of eleven, then ruled wider
    than the A4 they were cut for, and the page was reported too small
    for a table that fits it three blocks of seven. The sheet was
    refused for not fitting when a partition that fits existed, which is
    the feature failing at its job rather than a bookkeeping slip.

    So the count is searched rather than divided out: the **fewest**
    blocks whose ruled width fits, fewest because fewer blocks are wider
    blocks and a shorter sheet, and every count is asked with the width
    it would really be drawn at.

    What the search promises against the division it replaced is one
    thing and not two. It **never returns more blocks**: if the
    division's own count fitted, the loop reaches that count and returns
    there at the latest, so the answer is that count or fewer. It does
    *not* promise the same count. The division works out a capacity by
    ``(room - label_w) // name_w``, and floor division on floats is not
    the floor of the quotient -- where the room is an exact multiple of
    a column the subtraction can round below it, and a page that holds
    seven columns is read as holding six and the table is wrapped that
    did not need wrapping. An earlier draft of this function claimed the
    two were arithmetically identical wherever no section heading
    widened anything; a sweep of the no-heading cases found the claim
    false, in the direction of the search being right and the division
    wrong. It is a correction, and it is stated as one.

    A table that fits at no count at all falls back to one column per
    block, the narrowest a table can be ruled: it is then a page too
    small however it is cut, which the sheet reports in those words
    rather than this function guessing at.

    """A title-block field as the strip reads it: what the author
    stated, stripped, and blank only where they stated nothing.

    A field of nothing but spaces is *truthy*, so it defeated every
    fallback the block has. ``tb.title or name`` drew three spaces
    instead of the flowsheet's name; ``tb.status or "\u2014"`` and the
    drawing number's dash likewise; a whitespace ``client`` or
    ``project`` ruled an empty row and made the whole strip taller; a
    whitespace ``scale`` turned the four-cell bottom band on with
    nothing to put in it; and a whitespace ``company`` was accepted,
    wrapped to no lines and drawn nowhere. Six of the block's fields
    answered differently from the blank they mean, and none of them said
    so -- the same class of silent wrong answer as the rest of this
    strip, arrived at through truthiness rather than through width.

    Read *here* and not normalised on the dataclass because a block is
    edited after it is built -- ``fs.title_block.title = ...`` is the
    documented way to shorten a field and re-render -- and a
    ``__post_init__`` sees only what it was constructed with. Reading
    through one function also keeps :func:`measure_title_strip` and
    :func:`title_strip_layout` from disagreeing about whether a row
    exists, which is what would make the strip's own height wrong.

    This answers *what the author stated*, which is what decides which
    field a finding names and whether a signatory is the block's to
    backfill. What a cell **draws** is :func:`_stated`, one layer up:
    the same read, with the block's own default behind it.

    **Unset, not falsey.** The question this asks is whether the author
    put anything in the field, and truthiness only answers that for
    strings. Every field here is annotated ``str`` and nothing enforces
    it, so ``TitleBlock(sheet=1, of_sheets=3)`` is a perfectly ordinary
    thing to type and has always worked -- ``str(1)`` is ``"1"``. But
    ``sheet=0`` is falsey, so a truthy read discarded it as blank, and
    then :func:`_stated` filled the cell with the field's default: an
    author who stated sheet **0** was issued sheet **1**. That is this
    module's own subject committed by the code meant to fix it -- a
    stated value silently changed to a different stated value, which is
    worse than the blank it was guarding, because blank at least meant
    *unset*.

    So the test is ``is None`` and everything else is drawn as written.
    Refusing a non-string at the door was the other defensible answer
    and is not the one taken: it would break ``sheet=1``, which reads
    naturally, works today, and has nothing to do with the defect.

    Which of the two doors that is settled is why the reading itself is
    :func:`pandid.document._drawn_text` and not four words here. The
    spec reader has to arrive at the same text for the same value or
    ``from_dict(fs.to_dict())`` draws a different sheet from the one it
    was handed, and for a while it did not arrive at any text at all --
    it refused the ``0`` (#506). Strip is this end's alone: a cell
    letters nothing for a run of spaces, but a *file* keeps what its
    author typed.

    :func:`pandid.document._clean` strips a location reference's parts
    for the reason this strips a drawing field: whitespace at the ends
    of either has nothing it could draw.

    # is a scale to write in it. This band used to rule three when there
    # was none and hand the room back to the cells that identify the
    # drawing, which sounds like a kindness and is the defect. The scale
    # cell appears when the block states a scale *or* when a page size
    # lets the renderer state the ratio it fitted the drawing at -- so

    where the block states neither -- the flowsheet's name and today's
    date -- and are passed *unchosen*, exactly as the two renderers pass
    them, so that this and the sheet answer alike. Choosing first is
    what made a whitespace title a truncation the render reported and
    this did not.

    Whether a value fits is a fact about the *model*: every width the
    strip rules is a constant in this module, so the answer does not
    depend on the page size, on the drawing, or on anything layout or
    routing settles. That is what lets
    :func:`pandid.validate.model_issues` report an over-long title block
    on a sheet that has never been rendered -- the point of the finding
    being to reach the author *before* the sheet is issued, not to
    describe one that already was.

    It is the same measurement and not a second opinion about it: the
    layout is run with a collecting reporter and its ink thrown away,
    so a cell width can never be stated in two places and drift.

    ``fit_scale`` is the ratio the renderer settled on, which the scale
    cell reports for a block that states no scale of its own. A caller
    with no render behind it cannot know it and passes none, and that
    changes **nothing about any other cell**: the bottom band is ruled
    at four fixed shares whether or not there is a scale to write in the
    scale box, so the drawing number is budgeted the same 88 units under
    every call. It did not use to be -- the band gave the scale cell's
    room back to the three cells that identify the drawing, and
    ``drawing_number`` was measured against 118 units here and cut at 88
    by a render with a page size, which is exactly the silent
    abbreviation this module exists to report. The remedy was to stop
    the width moving, not to describe the two of them.

    The scale cell is the one cell whose *own* value this cannot
    measure, and it is the only one nobody typed: what goes in it is a
    ratio the dock settles from the page and the drawing, so it is the
    render's to report and the render does. Every value the **author**
    wrote is measured here, against the width it will be drawn in.

    of the caller's objects (the title strip, the stream table) and have
    the band maths size the frame around it too. ``inner`` is the
    drawing's own bounding box ``(x0, y0, x1, y1)``.

    ``sheet`` is a fixed page, or None to grow the frame to the drawing.
    ``too_small`` is called with ``(need_w, need_h, culprit)`` when a
    fixed page cannot hold its own furniture and must return the
    exception to raise; the caller supplies it because naming
    ``culprit`` in words is the caller's vocabulary, not this module's.
    It is only reached from inside that same overflow, so a caller
    whose page cannot overflow -- an empty ``items``, say -- may still
    leave it ``None``.

    Returns ``(placed, frame, free)``: the list of :class:`Docked`
    rectangles in the order the sheet draws them, the frame rectangle
    ``(x, y, w, h)``, and the region a fixed page leaves for the drawing
    (None when the frame was grown to the drawing, which needs no
    fitting).
