"""draw.io / diagrams.net (``.drawio``) export.

The SVG backend draws a finished picture. This one hands the reader back
the *model*: units as draw.io vertices, streams as draw.io edges between
them, so an author can open the sheet, drag a column two hundred units
left and have its lines follow. It is also the way to Visio, which
draw.io exports natively.

**The symbols in this library are draw.io's own P&ID stencils**,
vendored and converted (see NOTICE), so the export does not trace
geometry: it names the shape. ``mxgraph.pid.valves.gate_valve`` is a key
draw.io's stencil registry already answers to.
:func:`scripts.vendor_symbols.drawio_shape_key` derives it from the two
names in the stencil file itself, by draw.io's own rule, at the moment
the artwork is converted, and
:attr:`~pandid.render.symbols.Symbol.drawio_shape` carries it here. A
key that has stopped resolving is the quietest failure this file can
have -- draw.io answers one with a plain rectangle rather than an error
-- so ``tests/test_drawio.py`` walks every symbol the library can draw
and holds each reference against the vendored stencils.

Three things fall out of that arrangement:

* **Sizing.** draw.io scales a stencil into the box the cell is given,
  stretching it where the stencil says ``aspect="variable"`` and
  centring it uniformly where it says ``"fixed"`` -- the same question
  :func:`pandid.portgeom.ink_box` asks of
  :attr:`~pandid.render.symbols.Symbol.stretchable`, since that flag
  *is* the stencil's own attribute. So the box is the whole of the
  mapping, and the reproportioning ``SCALE`` in
  ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py`` applies to four families is already in
  the box the layout engine used. This holds only while every referenced
  stencil is ``variable``, and a test pins that.
* **Ports.** A draw.io fixed connection point is a fraction of the
  cell's box, which is what :func:`pandid.portgeom.port_point` already
  computes in absolute terms; dividing through is the whole conversion.
* **Ink.** ``scripts/mxgraph_to_svg.py`` converts a stencil with its
  fill state starting at ``none`` and every stroke at ``#111``, standing
  in for the ``fillColor``/``strokeColor`` draw.io would have taken from
  the style. Saying those two back in the style reproduces the sheet's
  ink, ``<fillcolor>`` overrides inside the stencil included, since
  draw.io honours those itself.

What is *not* free is written down rather than discovered in draw.io.
:data:`_APPROXIMATIONS` is every symbol this library draws itself
because draw.io has no stencil for it, each with the sentence saying
what its stand-in loses; the stand-ins are draw.io *built-ins* rather
than stencils, so a reference there cannot fail to resolve the way a
stencil key could. Sheet furniture is docked where the sheet docks it
and ruled the way the sheet rules it
(:meth:`DrawioRenderer._furniture`).

**Nothing on the sheet is silently absent.** Written down is not the
same as said, so every one of those sentences is *reported*: a stand-in
that loses something names the unit and what it lost on
``fs.warnings`` (:data:`APPROXIMATED`), and a title-block cell that had
to abbreviate its value says so there too, in the words the rendered
sheet uses and through the same
:data:`~pandid.render.furniture.Reporter`. An export that says nothing
lost nothing.

**A composed symbol is a group of cells, not a shape.** A body carrying
ISO 10628-2 supplementary parts -- an agitator in a reactor, trays in a
column, a settling arrow in a separating vessel -- names no stencil of
its own, and that is deliberate: a stencil reference names *one* shape,
so a stirred tank exported under the vessel's own reference would come
out a bare vessel, the right outline with the thing that made it a
reactor silently gone. It is drawn instead as **the body's cell with one
child cell per part**, each placed by the same fractions of the body's
box the SVG uses (:meth:`DrawioRenderer._overlay_cells`), so the two
backends draw the same parts in the same places from one set of numbers.
The ten group-28 agitators name draw.io's own ``mxgraph.pid.agitators``
stencils; the other twenty-seven parts have :data:`_PART_APPROXIMATIONS`,
which is :data:`_APPROXIMATIONS` for parts and carries the same sentence
each about what its stand-in loses.

**A model, or a sheet.** Given ``page_size`` this stops being a drawing
on an unbounded canvas and becomes paper: the file states the page, the
furniture docks to it rather than to the drawing's own bounds, and the
drawing is fitted into what the furniture leaves, all through the same
:func:`~pandid.render.furniture.dock` and
:func:`~pandid.render.svg._fit_scale` the rendered sheet uses.
``border="zone"`` then rules that page. Without a page size none of it
happens and the drawing keeps its own coordinates. See :class:`_Fit`.

**One** piece of sheet detail has no draw.io construct at all, and
simply is not drawn: a symbol's own lettering held upright under a turn
(the "M" on a motor operator), which draw.io turns with the shape.

The output is a plain uncompressed ``mxfile``. draw.io reads that as
readily as its compressed form, and it diffs.

What draw.io actually does
--------------------------

Everything below was read out of draw.io's and mxGraph's own source
rather than inferred from behaviour, because none of it can be checked
here: nothing in this repository opens a ``.drawio`` file. Each item
says where it came from. Line numbers drift; the function names do not.

* **A shape reference that misses fails silently, and there is no log.**
  ``mxCellRenderer.createShape`` asks ``mxStencilRegistry.getStencil``
  first and ``mxCellRenderer.defaultShapes`` second;
  ``getShapeConstructor`` then falls back to ``mxRectangleShape``.
  Neither table normalises case. A name beginning ``mxgraph.``
  additionally triggers a **blocking, uncached** fetch of
  ``stencils/<set>.xml``, retried once per referencing cell if it 404s.
  ``tests/test_drawio.py`` exists for this hazard. ``jgraph/mxgraph``
  ``view/mxCellRenderer.js``; ``jgraph/drawio``
  ``src/main/webapp/js/grapheditor/Graph.js``
  (``mxStencilRegistry.getStencil``, ``parseStencilSet``).
* **The stencil key rule**: lowercase the set's ``name``, add a dot, add
  the shape's ``name`` with spaces replaced by ``_``, lowercased.
  ``parseStencilSet``, as above.
  ``scripts/vendor_symbols.drawio_shape_key`` implements the same rule.
* **A style is ``split(';')`` then ``indexOf('=')``, with no escaping
  anywhere.** So ``;`` is the *only* character a value cannot contain --
  parentheses, commas, ampersands, hyphens and slashes, of which 49 of
  the 136 distinct vendored keys carry at least one (none carry an
  ampersand or a slash), are all safe. Two traps: a
  value of exactly ``none`` **deletes** the key rather than setting it
  (so ``shape=none`` draws a plain rectangle), and a token containing no
  ``=`` is looked up as a *named style*. ``mxStylesheet.getCellStyle``,
  ``mxUtils.getStylename``.
* **A dash pattern is separated by spaces and scaled by the stroke
  width.** ``createDashPattern`` splits on ``' '`` and runs each part
  through ``Number()``, so a comma yields ``NaN``; and
  ``stroke-dasharray`` comes out as ``pattern x strokeWidth x scale``
  unless ``fixDash=1``. See :func:`_dash`.
  ``mxSvgCanvas2D.createDashPattern``, ``mxShape.configureCanvas``.
* **draw.io has two anchor-point algorithms and they disagree.** The
  default, ``Graph.getLegacyConnectionPoint``, honours
  ``anchorPointDirection=0`` by skipping both the ``r1`` rotation *and*
  the 90-degree bounds swap a north or south ``direction`` would
  otherwise apply; the newer one behind ``legacyAnchorPoints=0`` swaps
  the bounds regardless. With the legacy one and ``exitPerimeter=0``, a
  point is: fraction of the bounds as placed, then the cell's flips
  about the bounds centre, then ``rotation``. That is the model
  :meth:`_constraint` applies, and the file says
  ``legacyAnchorPoints=1`` so it stays that way.
  ``Graph.getConnectionPoint``, ``mxGraph.getConnectionConstraint``,
  ``mxConstants.STYLE_ANCHOR_POINT_DIRECTION``.
* **A stencil cannot draw an edge.** ``mxShape.paint`` takes the stencil
  branch before the ``points`` branch, so a stencil named on an edge is
  stretched into the route's bounding box and no line is drawn. And a
  marker goes at an edge's two ends and nowhere else:
  ``mxConnector.createMarker`` is called twice, with ``pts[0]`` and
  ``pts[n-1]``. There is no mid-line marker style.
* **A line jump is a style on the edge that hops, and the hop goes on
  whichever of two crossing edges is written later.**
  ``mxGraphView.updateLineJumps`` reads ``jumpStyle`` off the edge being
  validated and intersects its segments against ``this.validEdges`` -- a
  list ``mxGraphView.validateCellState`` *appends to* as it walks the
  model in child order, so it holds exactly the edges that appear before
  this one in ``<root>``. ``state2.style['noJump'] != '1'`` in the same
  loop is the opt-out. See :func:`_hops`.
* **A child vertex on an edge is positioned by arc length, from its
  top-left.** ``mxGeometry.x`` runs -1 to +1 over the *routed*
  polyline's Euclidean length; ``mxGeometry.y`` displaces perpendicular;
  ``mxGeometry.offset`` displaces in plain drawing units; and
  ``mxGraphView.updateCellState`` puts the child's **top-left** -- not
  its centre -- on the point ``getPoint`` returns. Nothing is cached, so
  such a child rides the edge when a terminal moves. ``rotation``
  applies about the child's own centre, and there is no auto-orientation
  to the segment. See :func:`_hatches`. ``mxGraphView.getPoint``,
  ``mxGraphView.updateCellState``, ``mxShape.updateTransform``.
* **draw.io ships no P&ID signal-line style of any kind.**
  ``diagramly/sidebar/Sidebar-PID.js`` registers no edge template at all
  -- every entry in all thirteen of its palettes is
  ``createVertexTemplateEntry`` -- and nothing in ``stencils/pid/`` is a
  line. So the hatch in :func:`_hatches` is built rather than
  referenced.
* **``direction`` is a rotation of 0/90/180/270 for
  east/south/west/north, and north and south swap the painting box's
  width and height first.** They also **swap ``flipH`` with ``flipV``**.
  ``mxShape.getShapeRotation``, ``mxShape.paint``, ``mxShape.apply``.
  This is what :meth:`DrawioRenderer._flag_shape` turns an
  ``offPageConnector`` with.

#: The one ink the sheet is drawn in, and the one draw.io has to be told

#: same reason. Repeated here rather than imported from the script,
#: which is not part of the installed package.
_INK = "#111"

#: What the fill starts at, for everything this file draws itself: a
#: monochrome sheet lets the paper through.
_NO_FILL = "none"

#: What a *vendored stencil* is filled with, which is not that. draw.io
#: draws its shape, and no P&ID palette in it names a ``fillColor``, so
#: the page colour is what the artwork was authored under: its body is
#: the last ``<fillstroke>`` in the shape and covers the nozzles behind
#: it. See ``scripts/mxgraph_to_svg.DEFAULT_FILL``, the same colour for
#: the same reason. Written ``none`` here, the sphere's shell ran
#: through both its crown nozzles on the export as well as the sheet.
_PAPER = "#ffffff"

#: No ink at all. The same word, and it works for the same reason:
#: draw.io's ``mxStylesheet.getCellStyle`` *deletes* a key whose value
#: is exactly ``none`` rather than setting it, so the cell inherits
#: neither the style's colour nor the stylesheet default's, and
#: ``mxShape.configureCanvas`` strokes nothing. A cell drawn in it keeps
#: its geometry and stays selectable and connectable, which is the whole
#: point of using it for a junction that draws no ink of its own;
#: ``shape=none`` is the trap next door, since deleting *that* key falls
#: back to the default vertex and draws a plain rectangle.
_NO_STROKE = "none"

# --- line weights -----------------------------------------------------
# Every width below comes off :class:`~.weights.LineWeight`, the same
# ladder the sheet is drawn from, so the two backends cannot disagree
# about a rung. Until #490 this file held its own copies of two of them
# with a note saying both had to be edited together; a ladder they both
# read is the version of that note a machine can keep.
#
# A pen has to be *stated* on every cell here, which is the one thing
# this backend has to say that the sheet does not: all 319 vendored
# stencils declare ``strokewidth="inherit"``, putting the pen in the
# cell's style rather than in the stencil's own coordinate space, so a
# cell that says nothing draws at draw.io's default 1 whatever rung the
# element is on.
#
# And every one of them goes through ``fit.length``. A width is a
# drawing dimension like any other, so on a sheet fitted to a fixed page
# it scales with the drawing; stating one flat draws it out of
# proportion with the lines beside it.

#: The ink a *line* is drawn in, which is not quite the ink a symbol is
#: drawn in: the SVG renderer strokes a stream ``black`` and a converted
#: stencil ``#111``, and this is the first of those, written the way a
#: draw.io style writes a colour. A hundredth of a shade apart, and
#: copied rather than unified, since unifying them here would be this
#: file quietly editing the sheet.
_LINE_INK = "#000000"

#: The glyph draw.io hops a crossing line with, of the five its Format
#: panel offers (``none``, ``arc``, ``gap``, ``sharp``, ``line`` --
#: ``EditorFormatPanel.addLineJumps``). ``arc`` because the sheet draws
#: a semicircle: :meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_streams` writes ``A 5 5 0 0
#: 1`` and nothing else, and ``gap`` breaks the line instead while
#: ``sharp`` and ``line`` are a chevron and a pair of ticks.
#:
#: The arc is not quite a semicircle at draw.io's end:
#: ``mxConnector.paintLine`` draws a *cubic* whose two control points
#: stand off the run by ``1,3`` times the hop's half-extent, putting the
#: crown at ``0,75 x 1,3 = 0,975`` of it. So a hop sized to the sheet's
#: radius is a hundredth of a unit shallower. There is no key that makes
#: it an arc of a circle.
#:
#: **Which side it bulges is draw.io's and not the author's.**
#: ``paintLine`` takes the sign from the segment's own direction -- ``f
#: = (round(n.x) < 0 || (round(n.x) == 0 && round(n.y) <= 0)) ? 1 : -1``
#: -- which works out to *east* for every vertical run and *north* for
#: every horizontal one, whichever way round the run was routed. The
#: sheet fixes its sweep flag instead of its sign, so its hop follows
#: the routing: east down a run and west up the identical run. A
#: difference a reader comparing the two drawings will see.
_JUMP_STYLE = "arc"

#: ``jumpStyle`` for each of :data:`~pandid.render.svg.CROSSING_STYLES`
#: the export writes one for.
#:
#: The mapping is the identity on the two it has, which is why the sheet
#: spells its option in draw.io's own words rather than in a third
#: vocabulary that would need a table kept in step. ``"plain"`` is
#: absent on purpose: a sheet that marks no crossing writes no
#: ``jumpStyle`` at all, and :func:`_hops` returns nothing to write one
#: on -- ``jumpStyle=none`` would be a longer way of saying it and would
#: leave the edges reordered for jumps that are not there.
_JUMP_STYLES = {"arc": _JUMP_STYLE, "gap": "gap"}

#: An edge that is never hopped, whatever is written after it.
#:
#: The sheet's jump pass builds its two lists of segments from
#: ``fs.streams`` and from nothing else
#: (:meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_streams`), so on paper only a *stream* hops
#: and only a stream is hopped. Everything else this file writes as an
#: edge -- a ruled line of furniture, an instrument connection, a line
#: number's leader -- is an edge because that is how the format says "a
#: line between two points", not because it is a connection anything
#: flows along.
#:
#: draw.io has no such distinction and would hop any of them, so the
#: rule is stated rather than left to the emission order that happens to
#: hold today: ``updateLineJumps`` skips a candidate whose style says
#: ``noJump=1``. Saying it makes the drawing right whichever way round
#: the cells are written, which matters here more than usual, since
#: :func:`_hops` reorders them.

          style: str = "arc") -> "tuple[list, set, set]":
    """Which edges carry the hop, and the order that lets draw.io draw
    it.

    ``polylines`` is ``{key: points}`` for every **stream** on the
    sheet, in the order the streams are to be written; ``direction`` is
    :meth:`Flowsheet.to_svg`'s own ``jump_direction`` and ``style`` its
    ``crossing_style``. Returns the keys in the order they must be
    emitted in, and the set of them that is to carry a
    :data:`_JUMP_STYLES` entry.

    ``style="plain"`` marks nothing, so nothing hops, nothing has to be
    written after anything else and nothing is lost: the keys come back
    in exactly the order they went in. That is the same early return an
    unrecognised ``direction`` takes and for the same reason -- the
    reordering below exists only to let draw.io draw a jump, and a sheet
    with no jump on it must not have its edges shuffled for one.

    **Which line hops** is the sheet's rule, taken from the same place
    :meth:`SvgRenderer._draw_streams` takes it: a *vertical* segment
    crossing a *horizontal* one hops it, or the other way round under
    ``jump_direction="horizontal"``. Strictly inside both segments, as
    the sheet has it, so a run that merely ends on another one is a
    junction and is not hopped. Any other spelling of ``direction`` hops
    nothing, which is what the SVG does with one too.

    **Which line draw.io *lets* hop** is z-order, and that is the half
    the exporter has to build rather than state: ``updateLineJumps``
    intersects an edge only against the edges written before it, so the
    hopping edge has to be written after every edge it crosses. The
    streams are therefore emitted in a topological order of "crossed
    before crossing" rather than in ``fs.streams`` order -- stable, by
    original index, so a sheet with no crossing on it comes out in
    exactly the order it always did, and so does every part of a sheet
    that is not involved in one.

    Only the *hop* is per-edge; a style key cannot say "hop on my
    vertical segments and not my horizontal ones", and it does not have
    to. An edge H that is crossed at c is written *before* the edge V
    that hops it, so H cannot hop at c whether or not it carries
    ``jumpStyle`` for a crossing of its own elsewhere. "Hopper after
    crossed" is the whole constraint.

    Where it does not hold is a **cycle**: V's vertical crosses H's
    horizontal *and* H's vertical crosses V's horizontal, so each has to
    be written after the other. draw.io's model cannot express that pair
    and neither can this function; it satisfies every constraint it can
    and leaves the remainder in stream order.

    An edge stranded that way then **gives up its hop**, because
    ``jumpStyle`` cannot be aimed -- an edge carrying it hops every
    earlier edge it crosses, and after a cycle one of those is an edge
    that was supposed to hop *it*. A lost hop leaves a reader with an
    ambiguous four-way; a kept one would draw the wrong line passing
    over, which reads as a fact about the piping and is not one. So the
    sheet loses a hop rather than gaining a wrong one, and the filter at
    the end of this function is where.

No sheet in the shipped corpus reaches it. What does is a sheet whose
    recycle runs the length of the paper against a train that washes
    counter-current to it: two runs then cross each other twice, which is
    the shape, and a batch process is where it turns up. A test builds
    that pair directly rather than waiting for a drawing to grow one, and
    pins that the emitted order satisfies every crossing it kept.

    rendered sheet that fitting is one ``<g transform="scale(s)">``

    parser as the four characters ``<b>`` and not as a bold tag.
    :func:`_attr` then escapes the result again, for the *XML* layer the
    file itself is: this turns ``<`` into ``&lt;``, and ``_attr`` turns

        ``diagram`` says which drawing this is, in the spelling
        :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.to_svg` takes it: a P&ID
        draws its process lines without arrowheads and so exports them
        without one.

        ``page_size`` puts the model on **paper**. Without it the
        drawing keeps its own coordinates and the furniture docks to its
        own bounds, which is what a model is; with it the file carries
        the page draw.io is to rule, the furniture docks to that page
        instead, and the drawing is fitted into what the furniture
        leaves -- the same three things :meth:`SvgRenderer.render` does
        with the same argument, so the two open at the same size on the
        same paper.

        What it does **not** decide is whether the file states a page
        size at all. It always does, because draw.io does not offer a
        document the option of having none: a file that states no size
        is not read as unpaged, it is read as being on whatever paper
        the reader's locale defaults to, and PDF export then bounds the
        drawing by that. The long note beside the ``paper`` attributes
        below is the evidence, and :meth:`_page_box` is the size.

        ``border`` rules that page. ``"zone"`` draws the frame, the
        sheet edge and the lettered band between them; ``"none"`` leaves
        the page's own edge to be the paper's, which is what the sheet
        does too -- an unruled sheet draws no rectangle, it just stops.

        ``connections`` marks the joint a P&ID draws on a stream that
        does not say its own, exactly as :meth:`SvgRenderer.render`
        takes the same argument: ``"flanged"``, ``"none"``, or ``None``
        to mark nothing a stream has not stated. Ignored outside a
        P&ID. See :func:`~pandid.render.svg.sheet_connections`.

        ``crossing_style`` says what mark a crossing carries --
        ``"arc"``, ``"gap"`` or ``"plain"`` -- and means exactly what it
        means on the sheet; see
        :data:`~pandid.render.svg.CROSSING_STYLES`. Two of the three are
        draw.io's own line-jump styles and export as one; ``"plain"``
        writes no style at all and reorders no edge, so an exported
        crossing looks like the drawn one whichever is chosen. An
        unknown spelling is refused here rather than exported as the
        default.

        ``jump_direction`` says which of two crossing lines carries that
        mark, and means what it means on the sheet: ``"vertical"`` puts
        it on the vertical runs. It reaches draw.io as a style key on
        the marking edges *and* as the order those edges are written in,
        since z-order is what breaks the tie. See :func:`_hops`.

        ``show_stream_table`` docks the stream property table at the
        foot of the sheet and rules it as the grid it is, exactly as
        :meth:`SvgRenderer .render` does with the same argument: both
        backends measure it with
        :func:`~pandid.render.furniture.stream_table_layout`, so the
        columns are the same columns and the section headings fall in
        the same places.

        # by locale, A4 portrait 827x1169 everywhere except
        # en-us/en-ca/es-mx, which get US Letter 850x1100. So a file
        # stating no size opens on whatever paper the *reader's* machine
        # picks, and is a different document in Brisbane and in Houston.
        #
        # **And the size is what bounds a PDF.** The headless renderer
        # both drawio-desktop and the export server run (js/export.js,
        # `renderPage`) sets `graph.pdfPageVisible = !imagePageVisible`
        # for every PDF export, whatever `page` says, and then bounds
        # the export by `graph.view.getBackgroundPageBounds()`, which
        # snaps outward to a whole number of page tiles: a
        # 1950-unit-wide drawing against an 827-wide default tile comes
        # back as a 3x1 grid cut across the joins. PNG and SVG are
        # unaffected -- `Graph.prototype.getSvg` resolves the default
        # exportType='diagram' to `getGraphBounds()`, the drawing's own
        # extent. So the size is stated either way, and what is stated
        # is the sheet the SVG backend would have drawn: see
        # :meth:`_page_box`.
        #
        # **The page view is the separate question**, and
        # `readGraphState` spends `page` on `graph.pageVisible` and
        # `pageBreaksVisible` -- editor chrome -- and on nothing about
        # `pageFormat`. A model with no paper has no page to rule, so
        # page="0" is the true thing for it to say, and it is also what
        # makes such a model export whole: `renderPage` sets
        # `autoOrigin` when `page` is not "1", which mxPrintPreview
        # documents as "Specifies if the origin should be automatically
        # computed based on the top, left corner of the actual diagram
        # contents". An unpaged export keeps the drawing's own
        # coordinates and those routinely run left of or above zero
        # (`12_block_flow_diagram`'s frame starts at x = -34,

        outline with the thing that made it a reactor silently gone.

        its own inside it.

        The geometry is the composition's own arithmetic, unchanged: an
        :class:`~pandid.render.symbols.Overlay` states its rectangle as

        the whole conversion, and the two backends place a part by one set
        of numbers. ``tests/test_drawio.py`` measures that against the SVG.

        :meth:`_inscribed` sets out: a child moves with its parent and
        ``Graph.isRecursiveVertexResize`` scales it with its parent, so a
        reader who drags or resizes a column takes its trays with it.
        ``connectable=0`` keeps a stream from landing on a tray instead of
        on the nozzle it was routed to, and ``movable=0`` keeps a reader
        who grabs the middle of a vessel from dragging its agitator out of
        it.

        The pen is the part's and not the body's: ISO 10628-1 §5.3.1 puts
        an outline at 0,5 mm and the detail inside it at 0,25, and the
        sheet draws them at exactly that ratio (:data:`_PART_STROKE`).

        unit that was never laid out -- :meth:`render` already refuses
        one by name, before any cell is written. So the caller is the
        one that knows the frame is there, and handing it over is what

        the first.

        The safety-instrumented-system balloon is the case and today the
        only one: ANSI/ISA-5.1-2009 Table 5.1.1 column B draws it as a
        **square with an inscribed diamond**, where a bare
        ``shape=rhombus`` is Table 5.1.2's generic interlock and the
        symbol of the variant next door.

        **A child cell rather than a stencil.** Every shape named in
        :data:`_APPROXIMATIONS` is a draw.io *built-in* and never a
        stencil key. An inline ``shape=stencil(<deflated base64>)``
        would carry its artwork in the style, but a compressed blob is
        not the "plain uncompressed ``mxfile`` ... and it diffs" this
        file promises, and it would be the one shape
        ``tests/test_drawio.py`` has no stencil set to check.

        The pair holds together under editing:

        * **moving.** A child's geometry is relative to its parent's
          origin, so the parent moves and the child comes with it.
        * **resizing.** ``Graph.isRecursiveVertexResize`` answers yes
          for any non-swimlane vertex that has children, is not
          collapsed, states no ``childLayout`` and does not say
          ``recursiveResize=0`` -- which is this cell -- and
          ``mxVertexHandler.isRecursiveResize`` defers to it.
          ``resizeChildCells`` then scales the child by the ratio of the
          new box to the old, so the diamond stays inscribed. This is
          why the child is a plain vertex and not a group with a layout:
          a ``childLayout`` would switch the recursion *off*.
        * ``connectable=0``, so a stream dropped on the balloon lands on
          the square. Every fraction :meth:`_constraint` writes is a
          fraction of the square's box.
        * ``movable=0``, because the diamond is *part of* the symbol.
          The child is drawn over the parent -- children are validated
          after their parents -- so a reader clicking the middle of the
          balloon grabs the diamond and would otherwise drag it out of
          its square.

        ``fillColor`` is not the parent's: the square is already opaque
        white and knocks the hole in the line the balloon is dropped on.

        nozzle inboard of the box -- a dome crown, a shell wall drawn

        The line from a tap to the balloon reading it. It is not a
        stream and so is not in ``fs.streams``, and an exporter that
        walks only the streams hands back a sheet of balloons floating
        free of the plant. ISO 15519-2 §5.1.1 (document page 8, under
        Figure 6) does not leave that open: a PCI symbol **shall** be
        connected two ways, as Figure 6 draws it. To the process system
        it takes a solid functional connection line carrying nothing
        about signal direction or signal type; to the control system it
        takes a functional connection line that is solid or dashed
        according to which diagram this is (Clause 6).

        Which of the two a given line is, is
        :func:`~pandid.render.svg.impulse_tap`'s answer and not this
        file's, and the endpoints are
        :func:`~pandid.render.svg.tap_lines`': there is one derivation
        of where a tap runs and the SVG renderer draws from the same
        one.

        **An edge and not a drawn line**, because the balloon is the
        thing an author moves and a drawn line would come away from it.
        The balloon end is pinned to the balloon's own cell, at the
        centre, which is where the sheet runs it to and where the
        balloon's opaque body then knocks it out -- the balloons are
        written after these, so draw.io stacks them the same way.

        The other end is pinned to the *host's* cell where the host is a
        piece of plant, since the tap is the midpoint of a face of that
        cell and moves with it. Where the host is a **stream** the end
        is a floating point instead: draw.io can join an edge to another
        edge, but the point it would pick is its own, and a tap that
        slid to the middle of the pipe would be a different statement
        about where the reading is taken.

        One thing is reproduced faithfully rather than fixed: issue #170
        records that a tap is a single straight line, so a tap whose
        balloon is neither level with nor square to its host is drawn
        sloping rather than doglegged. The export slopes it too.

        strip into the bottom-right corner.

        The one thing that cannot follow the sheet is the *frame*. A
        rendered sheet may be a fixed page, and then the furniture docks
        to the paper; a ``.drawio`` file is an unbounded canvas with no
        paper in it, so the dock is given the drawing's own bounds and
        grows a frame around them. On a sheet drawn at
        ``page_size="A3"`` the corners are therefore the drawing's
        rather than the page's, which is the only relationship that
        survives the reader re-laying the model out by hand.

        **Ruled, not run together.** A box whose rows have columns in
        them is a *table*, and draw.io has real ones: a ``shape=table``
        carrying ``shape=tableRow`` children carrying
        ``shape=partialRectangle`` cells, which open as an editable grid

        single column into a grid would invent structure the author did
        not write.

        **Ruled where the sheet rules it, and not everywhere a grid
        could be ruled.** A table's rows and cells are what make it
        editable; its *lines* are a separate question and the answer is
        the sheet's. An :class:`~pandid.document.Annotation` is drawn on
        paper as a box with a title bar and rows of text -- no column
        rules, no row rules -- so it is exported with
        ``rowLines=0;columnLines=0`` and keeps its cells (see
        :data:`_ANNOTATION_KEYS`). A :class:`~pandid.document.TableBox`

        Only where the sheet rules one. An unruled sheet draws no
        rectangle at all -- ``_place_furniture`` takes ``sheet_rect``
        for the canvas bounds and strokes nothing -- so an unruled
        export draws none either, and what the reader sees as the edge
        of the paper is the page draw.io is now told to rule. Inventing
        a rectangle here would put ink on the sheet that the rendered
        one does not have.

        The geometry is :func:`pandid.render.furniture.zone_layout`'s,
        so the band is divided into the same fields, lettered the same
        way round.

        A caveat worth the author knowing, and it is why this was argued
        about rather than just added: a zone grid is an **address
        space**. ISO 15519-1 Clause 9 addresses documents, sheets, and
        columns, rows and zones on a sheet against it, and
        :attr:`pandid.units._Boundary.reference` is where this library
        writes such addresses. On paper they hold
        because the sheet holds. In an editable model they do not: drag
        a column two hundred units left and it is in a different zone
        from the one every reference on the sheet names, while the grid
        still looks authoritative. So what is exported here is a
        **snapshot of the grid at export time**, true of the drawing as
        it left pandid and no longer true of it once the reader has

        The strip is one rectangle and three columns: a revision grid on
        the left, a company cell in the middle, and on the right an
        information block of bands of unequal depth -- a title band with
        the sheet count tucked into its corner, a status band, and a
        bottom band ruled into DRAWING No / SCALE / DATE / REV. Only the
        first is a uniform grid, and a draw.io table gives every cell in
        a row that row's height (``TableLayout.layoutRow``), so the
        other two cannot be tables without becoming a list of label and
        value, one field per row -- which holds every value and looks
        nothing like the sheet.

        So the bands go out as what they are: a rectangle, some rules,
        and text at the sizes and weights the sheet letters them at,
        read from :func:`~pandid.render.furniture.title_strip_layout`,
        which :func:`~pandid.render.furniture.draw_title_strip` strokes
        into SVG from the same list of parts. **There is no strip
        arithmetic in this method at all**: a band whose depth is 0,4 of
        the block is 0,4 of it in both backends because neither backend
        works it out.

        **The revision history stays a real table**, and it is the only
        piece that could be one: a grid of six named columns with one
        row per revision, and the one part of an issued title block a
        reader actually edits. See :func:`_rev_table`.

        The cost, plainly: the eleven identification fields are not
        cells of a grid, so a reader changing the drawing number
        double-clicks a text label and there is no column rule to drag.
        Every field is still a cell of its own with its own id, and so
        is every rule.

        ``report`` is why the layout is asked for by name rather than
        with the arguments alone. The strip is fixed geometry and a value
        too long for its cell is abbreviated to an ellipsis, which tells
        a reader that something was cut and tells the program that
        supplied it nothing -- so an issued sheet exported to draw.io
        carried a *wrong drawing number* silently. The sheet has said so
        since the cells were ruled; this says it too, in the same words.

#: ``mxCellRenderer.getLabelBounds`` takes a separate branch for an

#: ``rotateLabelBounds`` -- the only place either label-position style
#: changes any geometry. The other reader, ``updateVertexLabelOffset``,
#: is vertex-only by name. An edge label is moved by its geometry and by
#: nothing else.
#:
#: ``horizontal=0`` is the exception, added per number in

#: turns such a number a quarter to read bottom to top (ISO 15519-1
#: §7.2.5, and §5.1.5 for the reading direction taken from the
#: right-hand edge of the document), so the paper the search reserved

#:
#: Unlike the two above it does reach an edge label:
#: ``mxText.getTextRotation`` defers to ``mxShape.getTextRotation``,
#: which adds ``mxText.verticalTextRotation`` -- **-90**, bottom to top,
#: the way round the sheet turns it -- whenever ``horizontal`` is not 1.
#: That is a property of the *shape*, and an edge has one
#: (``mxConnector``). The opaque halo turns with it: ``mxSvgCanvas2D``
#: puts the background on the same transformed group as the glyphs.

    """A line number's place on its edge: how far along, and how far
    across.

    ``mxGraphView.getPoint`` is the whole of the mechanism and it is
    exact enough to reproduce the sheet's own placement rather than
    approximate it. For an edge whose geometry is ``relative``,
    ``geometry.x`` runs -1 to +1 over the routed polyline's Euclidean
    arc length -- ``dist = Math.round((geometry.x / 2 + 0.5) *
    state.length)`` -- and ``geometry.offset``, an ``<mxPoint
    as="offset">``, displaces the label from there in plain drawing
    units, multiplied by the view's zoom and by nothing else.

    **The offset and not ``geometry.y``**, which is the other
    displacement on offer and is a trap. ``getPoint`` applies it as
    ``(nx * gy, -ny * gy)`` where ``nx = dy/segment`` and ``ny =
    dx/segment``, so its sign is taken from the direction the segment
    happens to be *routed* in: the same positive number puts a label
    above a run drawn left to right and below the identical run drawn
    right to left. Which end of a stream is its source is a fact about
    the process and not about the paper, so a perpendicular offset
    stated that way would put half this sheet's numbers on the wrong
    side of their lines. The offset is axis-aligned and direction-free,
    and the sheet's answer is already an absolute point.

    The along-run figure is taken by projecting that point onto the
    segment the number names -- clamped to the segment, so a number the
    sheet slid past the end of a short run stays attached to it and the
    overrun goes into the offset instead. The label lands on the same
    paper either way; what the clamping buys is that the number rides
    its own segment when a reader drags the plant about, rather than
    jumping to whichever piece of the route the arc length then points

    would point somewhere the sheet does not.

    ``noJump=1`` because a leader is not a connection and the sheet's
    jump pass never sees one; see :data:`_NO_HOP`. ``ink`` is the
    label's colour, which ``stream_numbers`` takes from ``s.color``, so
    it is passed in, in the spelling :data:`_LINE_INK` settles on rather
    than in the SVG's ``black``. The weight is
    :attr:`~pandid.render.weights.LineWeight.DETAIL`, because §6.4 hands the

    ISO 15519-2 §6.2 (document page 14) is what makes this worth the
    trouble rather than decoration: it keeps the symbols that mark a
    signal medium -- pneumatic, hydraulic and the rest, drawn in Annex A
    -- for telling a minority apart from an otherwise electric sheet.

    Which is ``examples/11``'s case: most of its signal lines are
    electric or software and the pneumatic ones run to actuators.

    **There is no native way to draw it.** ``Sidebar-PID.js`` registers
    no edge template at all and no stencil in the set is a signal line.
    Nor can a stencil describe an edge: ``mxShape.paint`` takes the
    stencil branch before the edge branch, so a stencil named on an edge
    is stretched into the route's bounding box and the line is not
    drawn. And mxGraph puts a marker at an edge's two ends and nowhere
    else -- ``mxConnector.createMarker`` is called twice, with
    ``pts[0]`` and ``pts[n-1]``.

    What there is, is a **child vertex on the edge**, the mechanism
    draw.io's own edge labels ride on. ``mxGraphView.getPoint`` maps
    ``mxGeometry.x`` in ``[-1, 1]`` onto distance along the *routed*
    polyline by arc length, and ``mxGraphView.updateCellState`` puts the
    child's **top-left** on the point it returns -- not its centre,
    which is why every offset below carries a ``-length/2``.
    ``mxGeometry.offset`` displaces it in plain drawing units. Nothing
    is cached, so dragging a balloon re-routes the line and the marks
    move with it.

    Two departures from the sheet, neither silent:

    * **the stroke does not re-orient.** mxGraph has no auto-orientation
      for a shape on an edge (``labelAutoRotate`` turns *text*, not
      shapes), so the angle is computed here from the segment the mark
      falls on and written as a ``rotation``. Re-route the line through
      a turn and a mark keeps the angle it was exported with.
    * **the mark is a built-in ``line``, twice**, rather than one glyph,
      so the double hatch is two cells a reader can select apart.

    A *proportional* share of the box is not a measurement of anything:
    a narrow column beside a wide one gets a narrow share of a box that
    is only just wide enough, which clipped the legend's ``HPSSH`` to
    ``HPSS``. So every column is measured at
    :func:`pandid.render.furniture.text_width`, which is what the SVG

    shortfall is shared out in proportion, since a box too narrow for
    its contents has to clip somewhere and the sheet clips it too.

    ``sizes`` is the font size per column, because a title block sets
    its field captions smaller than its values and a column has to be
    measured at the size it will be *drawn* at.

    ``bold`` is the same statement about *weight*, per column, and a
    sequence because the title strip sets its captions light and its
    **values** bold. Bold is the wider face -- ``_ADV_BOLD`` against
    ``_ADV`` is 0,62 against 0,56, eleven per cent -- so a column
    measured in the wrong face clips or wastes the room the column
    beside it needed. The caller states it because the caller is what

    """A ruled grid, as draw.io's own table: container, rows, cells.

    ``widths`` are absolute column widths and must sum to ``w``; they
    come from :func:`columns`, or from the sheet's own ruling where it
    has one (a revision strip is ruled at fixed widths and this
    reproduces them). ``start`` is the height of the title band, which
    is a table container's swimlane head and carries the box's title; a
    box with no title is given ``startSize=0`` and no band at all.

    ``font`` is the size the cells are *drawn* at, and it is stated **on
    every cell** rather than left to draw.io or to the table. draw.io's
    default is 12 while every box on the sheet measures its own text at
    its ``font_size``, and a column measured at 11 and drawn at 12 is a
    column three-quarters of a letter too narrow.

    Saying it once on the container does not work, because **mxGraph
    does not inherit a style from a parent cell.**
    ``mxGraph.getCellStyle`` resolves a cell's own style string against
    the stylesheet's default and stops; the only key on a draw.io table
    that reaches down the tree is the literal value ``inherit``, which
    ``Graph.getCellStyle`` special-cases for ``strokeColor``,
    ``fillColor`` and ``gradientColor`` alone -- which is why every row
    and cell here says ``strokeColor=inherit`` in as many words rather
    than simply not mentioning ink. A ``fontSize`` on the container
    styles the container's *own* label, the table's title band, and
    nothing else.

    It goes in ahead of ``col_keys`` so a column that sets a size of its
    own still wins: a style is parsed left to right into a dictionary
    (``mxStylesheet.getCellStyle``), so the last statement of a key
    stands.

    ``row_h`` rules every row at that height and lets the table be as
    tall as its rows come to; the default fills ``h`` instead. Eleven
    title-block fields stretched to fill an eighty-unit strip are rows
    5.6 units tall, which draw no text at all and read as a grid of
    empty rules.

    ``header_last`` puts the heading row at the foot, which is where a
    revision history has it: the newest revision sits against the
    heading and the older ones climb away from it.

    ``heights`` rules the rows at *stated* depths rather than at one
    depth. A revision grid is the case: the sheet rules its revisions at
    14 apiece and leaves whatever is over as blank paper above them, so
    the grid is not a uniform stack and cannot be written as one. They
    are shared out through :func:`_distribute` like the widths, and so
    add up to the table exactly as written.

    ``keys`` are table-level style keys for the caller's own case --
    ``rowLines=0`` for a grid the sheet does not rule across, a
    ``strokeWidth`` for one it rules lighter. They go on the container,
    which is where a table draws its own row and column lines from
    (``TableShape.paintTableForeground`` reads
    ``rowLines``/``columnLines`` off exactly this style).

    ``row_widths`` rules each row's cells at *stated* widths rather than
    at one set of column widths, and it is what lets a row hold a
    **different number of cells** from the row above it: the cell count
    of a row is the length of its own width list. A stream table's
    section heading is the case -- one cell spanning the whole table,
    which is the single rectangle the sheet strokes for it and what a
    merged cell is in this format. A table rules a column line at a
    cell's edge, so a row of one cell is a row with no column line in
    it, which is again what the sheet draws.

    ``cell_keys`` states each cell's own style, ``[row][column]``. It is
    for a table whose cells are not uniform across a row -- a stream
    table fills its heading row, its row labels and its values three
    different greys and sets two of the three left rather than centred.
    It replaces the row-level heading/body style rather than being added
    to it, because a caller that states what every cell is filled with
    does not want a default underneath it saying something else first.

    The cell is exactly one line box tall plus the inset, so the line

    measured a shade narrow than the browser sets it runs on past its
    box instead of being folded onto a second line halfway through a

    ``shape=table`` with real rows and cells rather than lettering that
    looks like one.

    **Ruled to the sheet's rules and no others.** ``rowLines=0``,
    because the sheet draws no rule *between* revisions -- it tells them
    apart by their lettering, and ruling each one would put six more
    lines into the busiest corner of the drawing.
    ``Graph.getTableLines`` builds one horizontal line per row only
    while ``rowLines`` is not ``0`` and takes the vertical ones from a
    separate ``columnLines``, so switching the first off leaves the
    column rules the sheet does draw. The single horizontal the sheet
    draws -- above the heading row at the foot -- is a segment of its
    own, at the weight the sheet strokes it.

    ``strokeWidth`` is the sheet's own hairline for those column rules.
    The table's outer border is drawn at the same weight and is
    invisible for it: the strip's own two-unit rectangle is on three of
    its edges and the company cell's rule on the fourth, so there is no
    edge of this table that is not already inked by something heavier.
