"""Flowsheet validation.

Separates two kinds of problems:

- **errors**: genuine contradictions the engine cannot honor
  (overlapping pinned units, negative or non-finite coordinates).
  ``render()`` raises on these rather than emit a wrong drawing.
- **warnings**: the drawing is valid but imperfect (a stream crosses a
  unit body, a route detours excessively, a tag spells its letters in an
  order no standard uses, a nozzle a count asked for has no line on it).
  Collected on ``fs.warnings`` for the caller; never fatal.

The findings are made in two halves, and :func:`validate` is both of
them run in turn:

- :func:`model_issues` reads what the author wrote down -- pins, tags,
  nozzle counts, stream names -- and touches neither a
  :class:`~pandid.geometry.Frame` nor a :class:`~pandid.geometry.Route`.
  It answers on a sheet that has never been laid out.
- :func:`geometry_issues` reads the resolved geometry: overlaps,
  coincident nozzles, crossings, detours, elevations.

The split exists so a render can check the model **before** it builds
any geometry, which is the order every render entry point documents.
``pin(x=nan)`` is the case that forced it: ``pin-not-finite`` names that
contradiction exactly, and the same coordinate is one the router starts
from and never comes back from, so validating after ``route()`` made a
perfect finding about a drawing nobody could obtain.
:meth:`pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet._prepare_to_draw` is where the order
is written down.

Geometric checks need resolved frames, and are made over the units that
have one. Not over the whole sheet or none of it: a balloon layout could
not place is one unit without geometry rather than a sheet without any,
and gating the block on the whole list let a single one of them hide
every overlap on an otherwise fully placed drawing.

Most findings are made by inspecting the finished flowsheet. Three are
collected from where an earlier phase parked them: ``route-not-settled``
and ``instrument-unplaced``, which only ``route()`` and ``layout()`` can
know, and ``deprecated``, which leaves no trace in the topology or the
geometry. See :mod:`pandid.deprecation`.

#: along the run and read as one elevation to :func:`_off_elevation`
#: while drawing a 2.4px rise. Straightening it is the one change that

#:
#: A device that merely *has* its nozzles at different heights does not
#: belong here: a pump's discharge is above its suction and the author

#: written down as such in that function. The rectangle it lands on is a
#: square at the body's natural box and a rectangle at any other, and
#: what is drawn inside it is a circle.
#:
#: **The narrowness is the measurement.** The other thirty-six
#: registered parts are lines, bars and decks -- a tray deck is 100 x 20
#: and is drawn 100 x 20 on any shell, a leg is a channel section, a

#: ``19_absorber_stripper``'s amine contactor, drawn 110 x 340 on a
#: 100 x 200 symbol because twenty trays need the room, and its cure
#: would be a 170 x 340 column no draughtsman would draw.

#: write 62 : 131,7778 down exactly. Over every whole height from 100 to
#: 400 units, the best whole width for the two stirred bodies the library
#: draws lands within 1,02 % of their aspect -- and where the author
#: picks both numbers it is far closer, 72 x 153 being 0,02 % out. A
#: threshold under that would report arithmetic rather than a drawing.
#:
#: *Above*, because ``agitator_overlays`` names 7 % oval on the plain
#: stirred tank and 22 % on the jacketed one as the defect it derives the
#: motor's height to avoid. A threshold above those would leave the
#: finding unable to say what the library already treats as wrong.

#: through on three tags: ``ICA``, ``CS`` and ``ICZA``.
#:
#: So ``FIC`` is right and ``FCI`` is wrong. Only these seven letters
#: are ordered: the first letter of a tag is the measured variable
#: (Table 2) and everything else is either a modifier (Table 3: ``D``,

#: gave them. A letter that *is* here can still be a modifier where it
#: qualifies a position switch rather than naming a function; see
#: :func:`_is_control_function`.
#:
#: ``M`` is carried because §5.2.4 lists it and is unreachable: the
#: clause orders it, and the control functions it orders are defined
#: without one, so no conforming tag has a letter to put in that slot.

    **The ``C`` that closes a position switch.** ANSI/ISA-5.1-2009 Table

    does. Read as *Control (closed loop)* it made ``ZSC`` -- a standard

    # a number nobody edits. That is what happened: adding item 20.6's

    # and ``examples/10_ethanol_pfd.py``'s hard-coded 80 x 100 -- right
