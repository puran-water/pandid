        A primary element is **one instrument shown as two marks**: the

        CHEE4001 p.10 settles that it is one instrument -- it defines the
        primary element, letter ``E``, as the instrument that measures
        the process variable, an orifice plate or a thermocouple say --
        and ``professional_examples/P&ID_301.pdf`` settles the drawing: its
        venturi carries **no lettering at all**, an ``FE 303`` balloon
        hangs under it on a short impulse line, and ``FT 303`` sits
        immediately below that::

            fe303 = fs.add(units.Fitting(flow303.element("FE"),
                                         variant="venturi"))

                                      at="S", offset=45)

        The tag is typed once, on the element, and moves to the balloon:
        the element stops drawing lettering of its own, so the sheet
        shows ``FE-303`` exactly once. Both objects answer to it, which
        is why the pair joins the sheet's "one thing, several marks"
        exemption (issue #249). The element keeps the plain name, since
        it is the item an equipment list schedules; the balloon is named
        ``FE-303 (2)``, as a repeated trip square is.

        ``at``/``offset``/``angle`` place the balloon exactly as
        :meth:`add_instrument` does, and the relation is ``sensing``, so
        a solid impulse line is drawn between them. The default
        ``offset`` is the reference sheet's, whose FE balloon centre
        stands 1,05 balloon diameters off the process line.

        A transmitter on what is being measured, a controller beside it,
        and the two signal lines that close the loop onto a final
        control element the author has already put in the pipe::

            loop = fs.add_control_loop("F", 101, measuring=feed,
                                       acting_on=fv)

            loop.controller      # FIC-101
            loop.final_element   # the ControlValve passed in

        which is the loop, the two balloons and the two signal lines of
        the long-hand -- :meth:`add_loop`, two :meth:`add_instrument`
        calls and two :meth:`connect` calls -- said once. It composes
        exactly those calls and nothing else, so anything true of a
        hand-built loop is true of this one.

        **It takes the final element; it does not make one.** A control
        valve is process equipment standing in a line, between two
        pieces of piping the author drew. Minting one here would be
        guessing where that piping goes, so ``acting_on`` is required
        and takes the unit -- or one of its nozzles, where the unit has
        more than one signal terminal to choose between.

        **The letters follow from the measured variable.** ``"F"`` gives
        ``FT-101`` and ``FIC-101``, ``"L"`` gives ``LT-101`` and
        ``LIC-101``, so the variable is typed once for the ordinary
        loop. A house style that letters them otherwise states the
        member's **whole** functional code -- a recording controller is
        ``controller_letters="FRC"`` on a flow loop, spelled as it is
        said and as :meth:`add_instrument` takes it -- and a code that
        does not open with the loop's measured variable is refused
        rather than composed (issue #448).

        **It states no distance of its own.** ``at``/``offset``/``angle``
        place the transmitter against what it measures, and
        ``controller_at``/``controller_offset`` place the controller
        against the transmitter, both exactly as :meth:`add_instrument`
        means them. Leave any of them out and ``add_instrument``'s own
        default applies, with the standoff resolver of
        :mod:`pandid.layout.attach` walking a balloon clear of whatever
        it would have landed on. Repeating those defaults here would put
        a second copy of every standoff in the package, and a number an
        author has to guess is what issue #439 was raised about.

        ``at`` is the one worth spelling out rather than referring to,
        because it means two different things and which applies follows
        from ``measuring``: on a **stream** it is a fraction ``0..1``
        along the routed path, and on a **unit** it is a face,
        ``"N"``/``"S"``/``"E"``/``"W"``. It is also the lever that moves
        a badly drawn loop furthest -- a fifth of a fraction slides the
        tap the width of a bay, and every line into the balloon follows
        it -- so an author reading this section is the one who needs it
        (#467).

        **A member is an ordinary unit and takes an ordinary pin.**
        ``loop.transmitter.pin(x=..., y=...)`` places the balloon
        outright, superseding the standoff on the axis it names; the tap
        stays on the host either way, so the impulse line still leaves
        the point on the line the bubble reads. A balloon stands in no
        grid, so ``col``/``row`` on one is reported rather than drawn.

        ``variable`` takes the :class:`~pandid.loops.Loop`
        :meth:`add_loop` returned as well as the measured-variable
        letter, and usually has to: the valve is tagged from the loop
        and is placed in the run long before the balloons go on, so on
        most sheets the loop is already declared by the time this is
        called. Given a letter instead -- with a number, or without one
        for the sheet to allocate -- this declares the loop itself,
        which is the spelling for a valve whose tag was typed literally.

        ``measurement_kind`` and ``output_kind`` are the two signal
        lines' :meth:`connect` kinds: a 4-20 mA measurement into the
        controller and an air signal down onto the diaphragm, which is
        what the defaults say. An electrically actuated valve is
        ``output_kind="electric"``.

        Cascade, ratio, split-range and override loops are **not** built
        here; each is more than one measured variable or more than one
        final element. Every part stays reachable, so building one of
        those on top of this is the long-hand it always was.

        Args:
            variable: The ISA measured-variable letter, or a declared
                :class:`~pandid.loops.Loop`.
            number: The loop number, when ``variable`` is a letter.
                Left out, the sheet allocates one; see :meth:`add_loop`.
            measuring: What the transmitter reads -- a stream for a
                flow, a unit for a level, a pressure or a temperature.
                Anchored as ``sensing=`` anchors a balloon on
                :meth:`add_instrument`, so the tap is drawn.
            acting_on: The final control element, or its signal nozzle.
            transmitter_letters: The transmitter's whole functional code
                (``"FT"``, ``"FIT"``). Left out, the loop letters it.
            controller_letters: The controller's whole functional code
                (``"FIC"``, ``"FRC"``). Left out, the loop letters it.

        Returns:
            The :class:`~pandid.loops.ControlLoop` handle. It draws
            nothing itself; its members are ordinary units and streams.

        Raises:
            ValueError: if a declared loop is given a number as well or
                was declared on another sheet; if either functional code
                is empty, is the measured variable alone, or opens with
                a different variable; if ``measuring`` or ``acting_on``
                is not on this sheet; or for anything the four calls it
                composes would refuse. **Every one of those is checked
                before the first write**, so a rejected call leaves no
                loop declared, no balloon drawn, no signal line and the

        Two isolation valves, two drain valves, one bypass valve on a
        leg tapped outside the isolations, and a size change at each
        end: the arrangement the CHEE4001/7103 guidelines draw and
        :mod:`pandid.stations` quotes. The units are added, tagged,
        described, pinned along a run at ``y`` and wired to each other;
        what is left for the author is the piping either side of it,
        which is what :attr:`~pandid.stations.ValveStation.inlet` and
        :attr:`~pandid.stations.ValveStation.outlet` are for::

            station = fs.add_valve_station(
                "CV-303", x=670, y=440, mirrored=True,
                description="Reflux", service="AE", sequence=303,
                size=80, schedule=80, spec="SS")
            fs.connect(t_draw.branch, station.inlet, service="AE",
                       sequence=303, size=80, schedule=80, spec="SS")
            fs.connect(station.outlet, fe303.inlet)

        The returned :class:`~pandid.stations.ValveStation` is a handle,
        not a unit: it draws nothing, reaches no equipment list, and its
        members are ordinary units that can be re-pinned, re-tagged or
        instrumented.

        Args:
            tag: The control valve's tag, and what the other members'
                tags are derived from.
            x: Left edge of the drawn station; ``y`` is the run's
                **centreline**, so each device lands on the line
                whatever its artwork measures. Give both or neither;
                without them the members lay out like any other units,
                and the four arguments that describe the drawn run --
                ``mirrored``, ``gap``, ``bypass_rise``, ``drain_drop``
                -- have no run to describe and are refused.
            mirrored: Pipe the run east to west. The station still
                occupies ``x`` rightwards; what reverses is which end
                the flow enters.
            variant: The control valve's variant.
            number: The number the members are tagged from, defaulting
                to the one in ``tag``. The escape hatch for a control
                valve whose own number is not what its station is
                numbered by: ``CV-301-1`` with ``number=301`` gives
                ``HV-301A``, not ``HV-301-1A``.
            isolation: Draw the two isolation valves.
            reducers: Draw the reduction in and the expansion out.
            bypass: Draw the bypass leg and its normally closed
                throttling valve.
            drains: How many drain valves, 0, 1 or 2. One goes upstream.
            description: The service in words. Each member's description
                is this plus what it does: ``"Reflux Isolation Valve"``.
            bypass_over: The member the bypass valve stands over, one of
                :data:`~pandid.stations.BYPASS_ANCHORS`; by default it
                sits in the middle of its own leg, where the reference
                figure draws it. Move it when something else already
                crosses there, most often a controller's output dropping
                onto the actuator.
            tag_scheme: Overrides :attr:`valve_station_tag_scheme` for
                this station only.
            gap: Edge to edge between devices along the run;
                :data:`~pandid.stations.DEFAULT_GAP` by default.
            bypass_rise: How far the bypass leg stands off the run;
                :data:`~pandid.stations.DEFAULT_BYPASS_RISE` by default.
            drain_drop: How far a drain leg hangs below it;
                :data:`~pandid.stations.DEFAULT_DRAIN_DROP` by default.
            size, schedule, service, sequence, spec, insulation: The
                line number's components, put on the bypass and drain
                branches. A branch off a tee starts a number of its own,
                and a bypass is the same service, size and spec as the
                run it goes round. The run through the station carries
                the number of whatever is connected to :attr:`inlet`.

        Raises:
            ValueError: for a station that cannot mean what it says: a
                bypass with nothing to bypass around, a drain count that

        """Create a stream from *src* (an outlet) to *dst* (an inlet).

        The returned stream already carries the number it will be drawn
        with; see :meth:`renumber_streams`.

        ``kind`` has to match what the two ports are: a signal kind runs
        between two signal connections (a valve's ``actuator``, an
        instrument's ``pv`` and ``sig_in``/``sig_out``) and a process
        kind between two process nozzles.

        **Left unnamed**, ``kind`` is read off the two nozzles by
        :func:`_inferred_kind`: both ends an :data:`_ENERGY_ROLES`
        nozzle -- a ``utility_in``, a ``utility_out``, a reactor's
        ``duty``, rather than a ``"process"`` port -- and the run is a
        duty and comes out ``"energy"``; anything else comes out
        ``"material"``. That inference is the whole reason the default
        is ``None`` and not ``"material"``: a kind the author *states*
        is the answer, and the sheet is drawn from it. Cooling-water
        piping between two ``utility`` nozzles is water in a pipe, and
        ``kind="material"`` says so and is honoured; ``kind="energy"``
        between two process nozzles is honoured the same way, from the
        other side. Neither is quietly changed into the other. Reading
        the value rather than asking whether it was given is #493, and
        was a defect rather than the design.

        The kind also decides where the run numbers:
        :meth:`renumber_streams` numbers every energy stream after
        every material one, so the same duty draws as a ``material``
        stream off a boundary flag and an ``energy`` one between two
        equipment utility nozzles.

        For a signal line either end may be the **unit** instead of one
        of its connections, and this picks the connection: an instrument
        mints a free one and anything else with a single signal
        connection offers that one (``fs.connect(ft305, fic305,
        kind="electric")``). Process piping always names its nozzles,
        since which nozzle is the whole question.

        ``size``/``schedule``/``service``/``spec``/``insulation`` are
        the line-number components; supplying any of them draws this
        line with its line number instead of a stream number.
        ``sequence`` is filled by auto-numbering unless it is given
        here. ``size`` is the line's nominal bore, ``schedule`` the wall
        it is bought to at that bore, and ``spec`` the piping class or
        material it is built to.

        ``ends`` says how this line's joints are made up and overrides
        the sheet's ``connections`` for this run alone: ``"flanged"``
        marks both, ``"none"`` marks neither, and a ``(source, dest)``
        pair -- in the order the two were just named -- states them
        apart. Left unset the line follows the sheet. It takes any
        member of :data:`~pandid.render.svg.CONNECTIONS`, so a single
        run can be marked at its nozzles alone on a sheet that flanges
        its valves, and the other way round. Never marked either way: a
        boundary flag, an instrument or a signal line, there being no
        joint to describe. Nothing is marked at all except on a
        ``diagram="p&id"`` sheet; see :meth:`render`.

        Raises :class:`ValueError` if any validation rule is violated.
        **A refused call leaves this flowsheet exactly as it found it**:
        no stream appended, both nozzles free, no pool member minted,
        every other line's name and sequence as they were. Most of the
        rules are checked before the first write and never get near one
        (:meth:`_resolve_connection`), but the numbering at the foot of
        this method cannot be: it runs on the sheet *with* the new
        stream on it, and a ``line_numbering_scheme`` that names nothing
        this line carries raises from there -- #451, which left the run
        drawn, nameless, with both nozzles taken and a corrected retry
        refused. So the whole body carries
        :meth:`_unchanged_if_it_raises` rather than the checks alone.

        rounds of this branch did, and each time the next thing anybody
        thought to check turned out to have been missed: the geometry was
        guarded and ``warnings`` was not, then ``warnings`` was guarded
        before the argument check and not before the model check, then
        both were guarded and the stream numbering was not. So the guard
        is wholesale (:func:`_snapshot`) rather than a list of the
        mutations known today, and the test behind it compares the whole
        flowsheet rather than the fields somebody remembered.

        **Installed as high as the call goes**, which is the only frame
        from which "did not produce a file" is decidable. Around
        :meth:`to_svg`/:meth:`to_drawio` alone it guarded everything
        except the step that sentence is about: both hand back a
        *string*, and the conversion and the write happen in
        :meth:`render` after those guards have let go. A disk full, a
        read-only directory, a path that is really a directory -- each
        an ordinary way for a render to fail -- therefore left the sheet
        numbered, laid out, routed and rewarned for a file nobody has,
        which is the exact state this exists to prevent. So
        :meth:`render` and :meth:`show` carry it around their whole
        bodies too, from the extension check to the last
        ``write_bytes``.

        The two nest, and are meant to. The inner guard restores to its
        own entry state and the outer to what the caller handed us; the
        outer restore then finds most fields already right and puts back
        what is there, since :func:`_restore` writes values rather than
        comparing them. Nesting is what makes the placement a free
        choice: a stage that needs its own rollback can have one without
        anybody having to work out whether some caller already has it
        covered.

        Only on the way out through an exception. A render that succeeds
        keeps every bit of what it did, including the cached geometry
        that makes the second render of one sheet cheap.

        **What ``objects`` is for.** #451 asks for the same invariant of
        :meth:`connect`, which runs per line rather than per render, and
        the default set is a snapshot per unit and per stream on the
        sheet -- 18 s to build 1600 streams, which is the quadratic
        build #285 removed put straight back. So a caller that can say
        what it writes to says it, and pays for that alone:
        :meth:`connect` names the sheet and the two units at the ends of
        the line, :meth:`_name_group` the segments of the run it is
        naming, :meth:`_number_tail` the lines numbered behind the
        process runs. Building 1600 streams goes from 8 ms to 58 ms
        rather than to 18 s, and the guarded set of each is still every
        field of every object in it.

        Naming the objects is not the compromise the field list was. A
        field list goes stale when a new field is written; an object
        list goes stale only when an operation reaches an object it did
        not before, which is a change to what the operation *is*.

        **One sequence and not ``*objects``.** An empty list has to mean
        "nothing to put back" and no argument at all has to mean "the
        whole sheet", and ``*objects`` cannot tell those apart:
        ``_unchanged_if_it_raises(*self._tail)`` on a sheet carrying no
        duty line reads as the second and quietly buys the 18 s.

        The order is the contract :meth:`to_svg`, :meth:`to_drawio` and
        :meth:`render` all state, and this is the one place it is
        carried out:

        0. refuse a drawing option no backend answers to, before
           anything at all is touched, so a refused render leaves the
           sheet exactly as it found it;
        1. number the streams, so any finding quotes the name that will
           actually be drawn;
        2. **check the arguments** --
           :func:`pandid.render.svg.check_render_arguments`: the page
           named, the border, the diagram, the hop direction, the joint
           marks, and everything the stream table's own sheet can refuse;
        3. **check the model** -- :func:`pandid.validate.model_issues`,
           the findings that need no geometry: a pin that is not a
           number, a symbol gravity fixes given a quarter turn, a tag
           out of sequence, a counted nozzle with nothing piped to it, a
           counted name already taken;
        4. resolve the geometry, laying out and routing;
        5. **check the geometry** --
           :func:`pandid.validate.geometry_issues`: overlaps, coincident
           nozzles, crossings, detours, elevations.

        Steps 2 and 3 precede step 4 because a model the validator
        rejects is a model the engine cannot lay out or route either,
        and the engine has no way to say so. ``pin(x=nan)`` is the case
        that named this method: ``pin-not-finite`` describes it exactly,
        and every render reached the router first, which was handed that
        coordinate and did not come back. The finding was made for a
        drawing nobody could obtain.

        Step 2 is there for the second half of the same rule: laying out
        and routing **writes to the flowsheet**, so a render that raises
        after it has left the model changed on its way to failing. An
        argument the renderer would have refused is refused before that
        happens, and a rejected call therefore leaves the sheet exactly
        as it found it. ``**arguments`` is whatever the render was
        given, passed through rather than restated field by field: this
        method has no opinion about any of them and adding one to a
        render call must not mean adding it here as well.

        It runs whatever ``check`` says. ``check=False`` turns off
        *validation* -- the findings about the drawing -- and an
        argument the renderer cannot honour is not a finding about a
        drawing; it is the reason there is not going to be one.

        Errors raise from whichever half found them, so a model error
        raises before any geometry exists. Warnings from both halves
        land on ``warnings`` together, model findings first, so that
        list is one sheet's findings rather than one phase's.

        ``check=False`` skips both halves and resolves the geometry
        alone, which is what it has always meant. It does **not** leave
        the previous render's findings standing: ``warnings`` is emptied
        here either way, so an empty list after a ``check=False`` render
        means nothing was found rather than nothing was looked for.

        its number as it passes through them (set ``unit.new_line_number
        = True`` to break the number at an important valve).

        leg or drain off a station is its own line, and the run it
        leaves carries straight on.

        A line carrying line-number components is named by its line
        number rather than its stream number, on the same terms: the
        first segment of a group that carries components supplies them
        for the whole group, so a line number survives an inline valve

        the sheet and quoted in the stream table; energy streams, also

        **Why this exists.** Numbering runs on every ``connect()``, so
        that the name on the object a caller is handed back is the name
        that gets drawn. A full pass is linear in the sheet -- every
        unit, to find the inline runs, and every stream -- so running
        one per ``connect()`` made building a sheet quadratic in its own
        size: 200 streams cost 0.05s and 1600 cost 3.3s, and 4.6s of a
        4.7s build was inside numbering. Appending one stream leaves
        almost every name exactly as it was, and this works out which.

        Three shapes, and only the first two are cheap:

        - **A run of its own.** Nothing joins it, so it becomes the last
          group and takes the next place. No earlier group moves.
        - **The next segment of a run already drawn.** It joins one
          group through an inline device and that group keeps its place,
          so at most that group's own segments are renamed -- which
          happens when the new segment brings a name or a line number
          the run did not have.
        - **A join between two runs.** Two groups become one, so every
          group after the second one moves down a place and the whole
          sheet is renumbered. Reported as ``False``.

        The non-material tail is numbered after the process runs, so it
        moves whenever the count of those does -- which is the first
        shape and no other.

        Every name still comes out of :meth:`_name_group`, the same call
        the full pass makes, so the two cannot drift. What this decides

        imperfections (a route crossing a unit body, a large detour).

        spelling :meth:`to_svg` takes it: ``"pfd"``, ``"p&id"`` or
        ``"bfd"``. Two findings depend on it. A P&ID draws no
        arrowheads, so nozzles pitched inside the head they would carry
        on a PFD are not a defect there. And ``stream-table-missing``
        answers ISO 10628-1 4.3.2 d), a *process flow diagram*'s clause,
        so it is silent both on a sheet declared a P&ID, which answers
        4.4.2, and on one declared a BFD, which answers 4.2.

        is not simply ``"pfd"``: an example that rendered a P&ID and
        then printed a bare ``validate()`` printed a PFD's findings
        about a drawing it had not made, and the mechanical cure of
        spelling ``diagram=`` out a second time is the very thing that
        drifted. Naming one here still wins, so a caller may ask what a
        model would report as some other drawing without rendering it.

        Both halves of the check, over the sheet as it stands: the

        first if they have not been run yet, or if anything changed

        ``show_stream_table`` says where the stream property table goes:
        ``True`` docks it at the foot of this diagram, and ``"sheet"``
        makes it a **drawing of its own** -- border, title strip,
        drawing number, and the table for a body, with no diagram on it
        at all. That is one file either way, so a set with both is two
        calls with two paths; see :meth:`render`.

        ``border`` rules the sheet: ``"zone"`` for the zone-ruled
        drawing frame, ``"none"`` (the default) for a plain edge. The
        grid runs ISO 5457 §4.4's way -- letters A.. top down, numerals
        1.. left to right, so zone A1 is the top-left corner. The title
        block and annotation boxes attached to this flowsheet are drawn
        either way.

        ``diagram`` says which drawing this is: ``"pfd"`` (the default),
        ``"p&id"``, also spelled ``"pid"``, or ``"bfd"`` for a block
        flow diagram. A P&ID draws its process lines without arrowheads,
        since flow direction is read off the equipment and the line list
        rather than off an arrow on every run; a BFD heads its lines as
        a PFD does and answers a lighter clause for what it has to
        state. ``diagram`` and ``border`` are independent: the frame is
        sheet furniture and a PFD carries the zone-ruled one as readily
        as a P&ID does.

        ``page_size`` draws a sheet of exactly that standard size
        (``"A4"`` through ``"A0"``), fitting the drawing into what the
        sheet furniture leaves; omit it to size the sheet to the drawing
        instead. ``jump_direction`` selects which of two crossing lines
        carries the crossing mark: ``"vertical"`` or ``"horizontal"``.

        ``crossing_style`` selects what that mark is, and its three
        values are three conventions the documents on disk do not agree
        between:

        * ``"arc"`` (the default) bridges the crossed line with a
          semicircle. It appears in no standard this project holds and
          on none of the reference sheets; it is the convention this
          library inherited, and it stays the default so that no drawing
          already issued changes.
        * ``"gap"`` interrupts the marking line instead, which is what
          ISO 10628-1 5.3.4 prescribes. **It has a cost the arc does
          not**: the break is taken out of the run rather than laid over
          it, so a crossing close to a corner can leave a short stub of
          pipe hanging between the two. No clause dimensions the gap;
          this draws it over the same span the arc spans, and an author
          who chooses it accepts that trade until the router can
          guarantee a length of clear run either side of a crossing.
        * ``"plain"`` draws both lines straight through, which is how
          ISO 15519-1 12.5 Figure 31 draws a crossing and how every
          interior crossing on the reference sheets is drawn. A junction
          is then told from a crossing by the *junction* carrying a mark
          rather than by the crossing carrying one.

        It is a property of the **sheet** and not of a line: a drawing
        that marked some crossings and not others would teach a reader a
        convention and then break it. Where a crossing sits too near a
        corner to carry the mark chosen, the drawing is still made and
        the crossing is reported as ``crossing-unmarked`` on
        :attr:`warnings` rather than dropped in silence.

        ``connections`` says how the sheet's joints are made up, as the
        double tick across the run:

        * ``"none"`` (the default) marks nothing;
        * ``"flanged"`` marks every equipment nozzle **and both sides of
          every valve and in-line fitting**, which is how a body is got
          out of a line;
        * ``"flanged-at-nozzles"`` marks the nozzles only and leaves the
          bodies in the run unmarked, which is what ``P&ID_301.pdf``
          draws.

        Reducers and tees are welded fittings and take no mark under
        either. Boundary flags, instruments and signal lines are never
        marked: there is no joint to describe. Only a P&ID marks joints
        at all, per ISO 15519-2 Table 5, so this draws nothing on a PFD.
        Which bodies are flanged is a drafting choice and no standard on
        disk settles it; see :func:`~pandid.render.svg.flanged_joint`.
        One line may say otherwise with ``connect(..., ends=...)``.

        ``debug`` draws the coordinate overlay under the diagram: a
        ruled grid carrying its own coordinates, a marker on the point
        every ``pin(x=, y=)`` sets, and a marker on every port. ``True``
        rules the grid at its default 50-unit spacing and a number sets
        that spacing. It is scaffolding for whoever is writing the
        placement rather than part of the drawing, and is off by
        default.

        When ``check`` is true, validation runs around the geometry
        rather than after it: the checks that read the model alone run
        **before** ``layout()`` and ``route()``, and the ones that need
        frames and routes run once those exist. Either half raises
        :class:`ValueError` on an *error*; *warnings* from both are
        collected on ``self.warnings``. See :meth:`_prepare_to_draw`.

        ``layout()`` and ``route()`` first if they have not been run
        yet, or if anything changed since they were.

        The drawing comes out as a *model* rather than a picture: every
        unit is a draw.io shape and every stream an edge between two of
        its connection points, so an author can open it in draw.io /
        diagrams.net and move blocks and lines by hand. It is also the
        route to Visio, which draw.io exports natively.

        The equipment symbols are draw.io's own P&ID stencils (see
        ``NOTICE``), so the file *references* them rather than carrying
        a tracing: what opens is a native, editable shape. The 82
        registry entries this library draws itself -- the instrument
        balloons, the junctions, the off-page flags, the conveyor, and
        every built-to-size shape added since -- have no draw.io stencil
        behind them and are approximated with draw.io's built-in shapes; :mod:`pandid.render.drawio` names each one and
        what the approximation loses.

        ``diagram`` says which drawing this is, exactly as
        :meth:`to_svg` takes it: a P&ID exports its process lines
        without arrowheads. ``check`` validates on the same terms and in
        the same order -- the model before the geometry is built, the
        geometry once it is. ``connections`` marks the joints, also
        exactly as :meth:`to_svg` takes it, and in the same places --
        the two backends ask one function where a flange goes.

        Sheet furniture (the title block and any annotation boxes) is
        docked by the same arithmetic the sheet docks it with, and
        anything columnar -- an equipment list, a legend, a numbered
        note list, a :class:`~pandid.document.TableBox` -- comes out as
        a real draw.io table with rows and cells rather than one block
        of text.

        ``page_size`` puts the model on paper, exactly as it does for
        :meth:`to_svg`: the file carries the page for draw.io to rule,
        the furniture docks to that page rather than to the drawing's
        own bounds, and the drawing is fitted into what the furniture
        leaves. Omit it and the drawing keeps its own coordinates on an
        unbounded canvas, which is what a model is.

        ``border`` rules that page. ``"zone"`` draws the frame, the
        sheet edge and the lettered band between them, with one caveat:
        a zone grid is an *address space* (ISO 15519-1 Clause 9) and
        :attr:`pandid.units._Boundary.reference` writes addresses into
        it. In an editable model those do not hold -- move a column and
        it is in a different zone from the one every reference names --
        so what is exported is a **snapshot of the grid**, true of the
        drawing as it left pandid.

        ``jump_direction`` selects which of two crossing lines carries
        the crossing mark, exactly as it does on the sheet:
        ``"vertical"``, the default, marks the vertical runs. draw.io
        draws the mark itself from a style key on the edge that carries
        it, and settles ties between two crossing lines by z-order, so
        the export states both.

        ``crossing_style`` selects what that mark is -- ``"arc"``,
        ``"gap"`` or ``"plain"`` -- and means exactly what it means on
        the sheet; see :meth:`to_svg`. Two of the three are draw.io's
        own line-jump styles and export as one, and ``"plain"`` writes
        no style at all, so an exported crossing looks like the drawn

        material stream, one row per property, and the section headings
        ``stream_table_sections`` asks for. It comes out as a real
        draw.io table too, ruled across and down the way the sheet rules
        it. ``"sheet"`` exports the table's **own sheet** instead, the
        same drawing the SVG backend renders for it -- border, title
        strip, and the table wrapped into blocks -- with every block a
        draw.io table a reader can edit.

        The debug overlay has no counterpart here and :meth:`render`
        refuses it for a ``.drawio`` path rather than ignoring it.

        The output format is inferred from the file extension:

        - ``.svg``: pure-Python, always available.
        - ``.pdf`` / ``.png``: require the optional export backend
          (``pip install 'pandid[pdf]'``), which ships as wheels and
          needs no system libraries. See :mod:`pandid.render.export`.
        - ``.drawio``: the editable draw.io / diagrams.net model, and
          through draw.io's own exporter the way to Visio. See
          :meth:`to_drawio`.

        A call that writes no file changes nothing. That covers the
        refusals -- an unsupported extension, an unknown option, a page
        too small, a model the validator rejects -- and it covers the
        write itself: a full disk or a directory that cannot be written
        to leaves the flowsheet exactly as it was handed over, with no
        cached geometry, no renumbered streams and ``warnings`` as it
        found them. See :meth:`_unchanged_if_it_raises`.

        Args:
            path: Output file path; its extension selects the format.
            show_stream_table: Where the property table of all streams
                goes. ``True`` draws it at the foot of the diagram;
                ``"sheet"`` writes the **table's own sheet** to this
                path instead -- a full drawing with a border, a title
                strip and a drawing number of its own, whose body is the
                table alone, wrapped into stacked blocks when the
                streams do not fit across the page. One call still
                writes one file, so a set with both is::

                    fs.render("pfd.svg", page_size="A1")
                    fs.render("stream_table.svg", page_size="A1",
                              show_stream_table="sheet")

                How the table is drawn -- its type size, how narrow its
                columns may be ruled, and what its own sheet is called
                and numbered -- is ``fs.stream_table``; see
                :class:`~pandid.document.StreamTableOptions`.
            border: ``"none"`` or ``"zone"`` (the zone-ruled frame).
            diagram: ``"pfd"`` (the default), ``"p&id"``, also spelled
                ``"pid"``, or ``"bfd"``. A P&ID draws no arrowheads on
                process lines.
            page_size: Draw on a sheet of exactly this standard size,
                e.g. ``"A3"``; omit to size the sheet to the drawing.
            connections: ``"none"`` (the default), ``"flanged"`` -- the
                double tick at every equipment nozzle and both sides of
                every valve and in-line fitting -- or
                ``"flanged-at-nozzles"`` for the nozzles alone. A P&ID
                only; one line may say otherwise with
                ``connect(ends=...)``.
            jump_direction: Which of two crossing lines carries the
                crossing mark, ``"vertical"`` or ``"horizontal"``.
            crossing_style: What that mark is: ``"arc"`` (the default,
                and the drawing this library has always made), ``"gap"``
                for ISO 10628-1 5.3.4's interruption, or ``"plain"`` for
                the bare crossing of ISO 15519-1 12.5. See
                :meth:`to_svg` for what each costs.
            debug: Draw the coordinate overlay under the diagram: the
                grid, every ``pin()`` anchor and every port. ``True``
                for the default spacing, a number to set it. Off by
                default.
            check: Validate. The model-only checks run before the
                sheet is laid out and routed, the geometric ones
                after; errors raise from either, warnings collect on

        can be previewed with its stream table, on a given page size, as
        a P&ID rather than a PFD, or with the coordinate overlay on.
        ``tests/test_show.py`` holds the two signatures equal, so
        a keyword added to ``render()`` and not to this raises there
        rather than quietly leaving the drafting call behind again.

        A **window** where there is one to be had, the way
        ``matplotlib.pyplot.show`` gives one: the sheet drawn in a
        resizable window, rescaled as the window is, and this call
        blocks until it is closed. It needs a display and the optional
        rasteriser (``pip install 'pandid[pdf]'``), since a window shows
        pixels and the renderer's own output is SVG.

        Without either, the sheet goes to the **browser** instead, which
        is what this always did, and the reason it went there is printed
        rather than left to be guessed at. A headless machine -- CI, a
