"""Single source of truth for unit sizing and port geometry.

Layout, routing, and rendering all resolve a unit's size and its port
positions *here*, so the drawn diagram and the routed paths can never
disagree: the renderer cannot forget a mirror flip the router applied
and leave a mirrored unit's streams visually disconnected.

:func:`resolve_port` is the single authority on where a port is: it
answers the port's drawn point, its routing anchor and its face
together, and :func:`port_point`, :func:`port_anchor` and
:func:`port_offset` are wrappers over it. The rest are its peers, not
its wrappers -- sizing, the symbol-to-box transform, the ink box, the
face a coordinate comes out of -- and are what it is built from.
Deriving a port's point, anchor or face anywhere else is the bug. Which
of a port's declared faces it puts the ink on comes from
:func:`chosen_face`, so there is one precedence (the author's, then the
engine's, then the symbol's) and one place stating it.

The placement is a parameter rather than something read off the unit, so
these work during layout (on a ``_Slot``) and afterwards (on a
``Frame``) alike. Where it is optional -- :func:`port_faces`,
:func:`resolve_size`, :func:`port_offset` -- it falls back to the unit's
own pin, then its frame; a caller about to change either must pass its
candidate, since the committed one describes a sheet on its way out.

    """Resolve a port's geometry: nozzle, routing anchor and face.

    All three together, because deriving one of them somewhere else is
    what lets the renderer and the router disagree. The anchor is the
    point projected onto the bounding-box edge the port faces (the full
    placed box, which is what :func:`unit_box` hands the router as the
    obstacle), so a symbol drawn smaller than its box is still left by
    way of the box it occupies. Feed/Product use their arrow-tip
    convention for both (the port sits at the tip, whichever way it
    points): ``py`` already comes out scaled to the placed ``h`` (see
    :func:`_drawn_placements`), so a taller flag centres its nozzle
    rather than leaving it at a fraction of the symbol's own 50-unit
    fixture. ``rot`` and ``mirror_y`` are read above and go unused on
    this path -- deliberately, not an oversight: the pennant *is* the
    statement of direction (east out of a Feed, west into a Product,
    the other way where ``mirrored`` flips it), so a turn or a vertical
    flip has nothing to add to it and is silently a no-op rather than
    a second, competing way to say which way the flag points.

    One rule, asked the same way at both doors into a placement --
    :meth:`pandid.units.Unit.pin` and ``pin:`` in :mod:`pandid.spec`:
    **a named nozzle must be what some stated coordinate is measured
    to.** ``axes`` is the coordinates the nozzle is offered for and
    ``measured`` the ones that are in fact measured to it, so the
    refusal is simply that the two do not meet.

    ``ranks`` is the grid lines the pin names. It changes no verdict --
    a cell and a nozzle sit together perfectly well, and ``pin(col=1,
    x=5, port="inlet")`` means x locates the inlet and the column is
    superseded there, exactly as a pin mixing grid and absolute always
    has. What it changes is the *sentence*: an author who wrote
    ``pin(col=1, port="inlet")`` gave a placement and no coordinate, and
    is better told why a cell is not one than told they stated nothing.

    That is why this is one rule and not two. Refusing a rank *beside* a
    nozzle was a second rule, and it made a placement the call accepted
    and the file rejected -- ``pin(port="inlet", y=440)`` then
    ``pin(col=1)``, or a boundary flag's ``pin(x=…, y=…, col=…)`` in a
    single call -- so ``to_dict`` wrote sheets that would not read back.

    **Ask this of the pin the unit will have, not of the call in front
    of you.** A rule read off one call's arguments is one you defeat by
    writing two calls, which is how the accumulated placement above got
    past it.

    ``drop`` is what the author strikes to keep the rest of the
    placement -- ``port`` for a whole ``port=`` or ``port:``, ``port.x``
    for one axis of the axis-by-axis mapping. It is the only thing here
    a caller supplies, and so the only reason two doors could word this
    differently; for the shape both doors can write, both pass ``port``
    and the sentence is the same to the byte.
