"""Drawing documentation: the title block and sheet furniture.

Attach a :class:`TitleBlock` to a flowsheet
(``fs.title_block = TitleBlock(...)``) and the sheet is drawn with a
full-width engineering title strip (revision history + company/logo cell
+ client / project / status / drawing-number / title / date / scale /
rev cells), the data fields ISO 7200 specifies for a title block and ISO
10628-1 §5.1.2 requires on a process diagram. Seven of the eight ISO
7200 mandatory fields have a cell; the eighth, document type, does not.
A PFD carries a title strip as readily as a P&ID does, so the strip
follows the block, not the border: ``border="zone"`` adds the zone-ruled
drawing frame around it.

Around the drawing you can place *generic titled boxes*:
:class:`Annotation` (a title over free-form, optionally columnar, text)
and :class:`TableBox` (a title over a bordered header+rows grid).
Equipment lists, notes, and legends are all just :class:`Annotation`
boxes; :func:`equipment_list`, :func:`notes` and :func:`legend` are thin
constructors for the common cases.

Add them with ``fs.annotations.append(...)`` (or
``fs.add_annotation(...)``); a box on the flowsheet is a box on the
sheet, whichever border is drawn.

    Clause 9, *Location references*, covers a reference to a document, to
    a sheet of a document, and to a column, a row or a zone on a sheet,
    each of them spelled against the §5.1.2 grid. It reserves the solidus
    for the sheet and the full stop for the column, row or zone, and
    fixes the order they are presented in: document, then sheet, then
    column, row or zone.

    So the three parts always appear in that order, each introduced by
    its own sign, and a part left out narrows the *scope* of the
    reference rather than changing its shape. That is what Table 2
    tabulates, and this function reproduces all seven of its rows:

    A document with nothing after it is the document itself,
    ``PFD-302``, which is what a real sheet's off-page connector
    carries, and what :attr:`pandid.units.Feed.reference` has always
    been given. The helper is therefore a way to *spell* a reference
    that names a sheet or a zone as well, not a new kind of value: it
    returns a plain string and ``reference=`` still takes one.

    ``zone`` is validated against §5.1.2 (rows are letters, columns are
    numbers, and a zone is the row's letter then the column's number),
    so ``"3B"`` raises rather than reaching a drawing back to front. The
    sheet reference is only checked for the two reserved signs, since
    sheet numbering is the drawing office's (ISO 15519-1 §5.2.3 requires
    only that the sheets of a set relate to one another).

    cell, ``status`` the issue-status cell (e.g.
    ``"ISSUED FOR REVIEW"``).

    ``client`` and ``project`` head the information block, above the
    title. Neither is an ISO 7200 field: ISO 5457 specifies no
    title-block data fields at all and defers them to ISO 7200, whose
    mandatory "legal owner" is the organisation issuing the drawing,
    which is ``company`` here. An issued sheet names its client anyway,
    so the pair is drawn. Either may be left blank and the line for it
    is not ruled.

    ``sheet`` and ``of_sheets`` are the two halves of the ``SHEET n of
    m`` count in the title band, and they are the only two fields that
    default to something other than blank: a drawing with no set behind
    it is sheet 1 of 1. **A blank half draws that default**, on both
    backends and however the block is edited, because half a count reads
    as a different sheet -- ``SHEET  of 1`` names no sheet at all, and
    is short enough that no width check would ever have spoken up about
    it.

    ``scale`` is the scale cell. Left blank, the sheet reports the ratio
    the renderer actually placed the drawing at, which is a real number
    once ``page_size`` fixes the page and nothing at all on a sheet
    sized to fit its drawing, which is at no scale to state. Give the
    field a value (``"NTS"``, ``"1:100"``) to state one regardless.

    The cell is **ruled either way**. A title block is a form and its
    boxes belong to the form, so an unstated scale leaves an empty box
    rather than removing one -- and the three cells beside it keep their
    widths, which is what stops ``drawing_number`` being budgeted one

    **An object rather than an attribute apiece, on purpose.**
    ``render()`` already carries nine keywords and three of the four
    output calls restate every one of them, so a table option spelled
    there costs four signatures; and a table option means nothing to
    ``to_drawio()`` differently from ``to_svg()``, because it describes
    the sheet rather than the file. Settling it on the flowsheet says it
    once for every way the sheet comes out. A bare
    ``fs.stream_table_font_size`` would have done as much for the first
    option and nothing for the two that followed it a release later:
    each such attribute adds a prefix-string to ``Flowsheet``'s
    namespace, a line to its ``__init__``, a key to the spec's top level
    and a paragraph to the docs, and nothing groups them. One object
    costs none of that, an option is a field rather than a fifth
    signature change, and validation of the group has somewhere to live.

    The three sizing fields compose. :attr:`font_size` scales both width
    floors, since both are stated at the type size they were chosen
    against; so a table sized down keeps its proportions, and a table
    sized down *and* ``"auto"``-ruled has no floor left to scale.

    The last two say who the table's own sheet is, and are read only by
    a render that asks for one (``show_stream_table="sheet"``). They are
    here rather than on :class:`TitleBlock` because a flowsheet has one
    title block and that one is the *diagram's*: the table sheet's is
    derived from it (:func:`table_sheet_block`), and what a derivation
    needs is the two fields it cannot work out for itself.

    :attr:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.stream_table_sections` is *not*

    #:
    #: **One size for the whole sheet.** The enclosure is measured once,

    #: that size -- so ``1`` and ``1000`` get the same diamond. Sizing

    #: convention and one drawn off the line has no reading at all.
    #: A shape too big for the paper beside its run is drawn there
    #: anyway, crossing whatever is under it -- so **spacing the sheet
    #: is the author's lever**, and every crossing is named on

    #: **Nothing is hidden by any of it.** The shape is ruled as an
    #: outline, and the plate under the words is laid down only where
    #: it covers the run being labelled and nothing else; where the run
    #: is too short to hold it clear anywhere along it, no plate is laid

    #: and ``validate()`` cannot see it because the topology is
    #: untouched.
    #:
    #: A sheet lettered with full line numbers pays for the longest of
    #: them at every label -- ``AE-304-150-80-SS`` rules a diamond over
    #: 200 units wide -- which is the case the convention fits worst.
    #: ``"circle"`` is much the tightest of the three on a long label,
    #: at the cost of reading like an instrument balloon on a sheet
