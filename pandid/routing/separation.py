    prices crossings against something much closer to the sheet that will
    actually get drawn than raw, pre-separation geometry -- without making
    the drawn sheet itself depend on routing order, which running the real,
    writing pass more than once would (see ``_compute_offsets``).

    Not a perfect match for the final drawing even so: a stream not yet
    routed can still pull an *already*-recorded track when it is added, the
    same way any later stream in this preview's own set can -- ``_compute
    _offsets`` resolves every run against every other one *currently*
    passed to it, from each one's own raw, undisplaced track, so a track
    two streams settled between themselves is not fixed once a third
    arrives to share it. Concretely: two unfixed runs sharing a track
    resolve to +0px/+6px; add a *third*, port-fixed run onto the +6px one
    -- unremarkable on its own, a fixed run always keeps its own track --
    and the recompute that follows moves *both* of the first two again,
    to +12px/+0px, not just makes room for the newcomer.

    #483's own corpus does exercise this, measured correctly the second
    time: capturing each stream's preview *at its own* ``settle()`` call
    (not the last preview it happens to appear in, which is a different
    question and trivially matches the final pass by construction) and
    comparing against its final, post-``separate_streams`` waypoints finds
    14 divergences out of 1032 already-routed streams checked, across both
    the pinned and auto-placed forms of all 21 shipped examples -- max
    shift 19.37px, all five on auto-placed sheets. The consequence is real:
    a later search can be undercharged for a crossing the finished drawing
    actually has, because the earlier stream's track moves again after
    that search already ran. Tracked as #509, with a reproduced case
    (``06_column_reflux+auto``, streams ``S7``/``S5``) rather than fixed
    here -- closing it needs either a second, full-set-aware separation
    pass before the crossing-sensitive decisions, or re-checking every
    stream against the real geometry after ``separate_streams``'s one true
    pass, both a larger change than this preview mechanism itself.
