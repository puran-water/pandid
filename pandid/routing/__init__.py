    A* returns nothing when the two escape nodes are not connected on the
    lane grid -- most often because one of them has been sealed inside a
    neighbouring unit, which leaves it out of the graph entirely and so
    with no edges to search along. Something still has to be drawn, and an
    L through the two projections is it.

    Which L, though, is a choice, and it was not being made: the corner
    always went across first and then down, wherever that landed. Both
    orders are candidates here and the one crossing fewer obstacles wins;
    a tie on obstacles is broken by which crosses fewer already-drawn
    lines (``crossing_index``, when the caller has one -- this function is
    also called before any stream has been routed, from tests and from
    ``route_quality.py``'s own probes, where there is nothing yet to
    cross), and the across-first order keeps whatever tie is left, so a
    sheet nothing is in the way of draws exactly what it drew before.

    Considering obstacles first and lines second, not the other way round
    or as one combined score, is deliberate: a line drawn through a vessel
    is a worse defect than one drawn over another line, which is a stated
    convention with its own hop (#384), not damage. This function is not
    part of the search, so it cannot weigh the two against each other the
    way ``CROSSING_PENALTY`` weighs a crossing against a bend inside
    ``find_path`` -- it only ever has two fixed candidates to rank, and
    ranks them the same way an author choosing by eye would: clear of
    equipment first, clear of other lines second.

    Where every candidate is blocked there is no better line to draw --
    the search has already established that the grid has none -- so the
    least bad one goes down and ``validate()`` names it, under
    ``route-crosses-unit``. Silently preferring a clear L when one exists
    is the half that belongs here; saying so when none does is the half
    that belongs there.

    Any corner repeating the point before it is dropped. Two projections
    already in one column put the corner on top of ``start_proj``, and the
    caller's simplifier keeps both verbatim (it never drops a projection
    point), leaving a zero-length segment that the separation pass then
    reads as a horizontal run on a track the stream does not occupy.
