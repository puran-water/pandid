    Each end claims its own escape distance before the run is allowed to turn,
    and the two claims are made independently. Nozzles pointing at each other
    across less room than the claims add up to therefore overshoot each other:
    the source's escape node lands beyond the destination's nozzle and the
    destination's lands back behind the source's, so the leg between them is
    drawn backwards over both stubs. A 13px span came out as 87px of path, most
    of it on top of itself and through the source symbol.

    There is no room for two stand-offs, so the pair takes one between them and
    both escape nodes move to the middle of the gap. The run across is then the
    straight line, and neither stub is drawn twice. A control valve station
    packs an isolation valve, a reducer, the valve, another reducer and a second
    isolation valve into spans narrower than one stand-off, so this is what lets
    a sheet be drawn at the density a real one is drawn at.

    Both ends have to turn on the *same* lane for neither to overshoot, which is
    a real constraint and not only a relaxation: it is the one column (or row)
    the run may cross on. Nozzles that also sit on different lanes have to
    travel along it, so if anything is in the way the pair keeps its full
    stand-offs and the search picks its own way round instead. Ports facing each
    other on one lane meet on it and travel nowhere, so nothing can be in the
    way and that case always takes the relaxation.
