"""Build a flowsheet from data: the declarative spec format.

The other door beside the topology API (``fs.add`` / ``fs.connect``): a
plain mapping describing the same flowsheet, plus the serializer that
writes one back out, so a diagram round-trips through data.

    fs = Flowsheet.from_dict(spec)   # plain dict, no dependencies
    fs = Flowsheet.from_json(path)   # stdlib only
    fs = Flowsheet.from_yaml(path)   # needs the PyYAML extra
    spec = fs.to_dict()              # feeds back into from_dict()

The spec is *validated*, not interpreted: an unknown key is an error
rather than a silent no-op, because a typo in a hand-written file must
not quietly drop a nozzle off the sheet. Every message names the entry
it came from (``units[3] 'P-101'``) and lists what would have been
accepted, in the style of :meth:`pandid.units.Unit.port`.

The format::

    name: Feed Metering Skid      # required; the rest is optional
    stream_naming_scheme: "S{n}"
    stream_number_start: 1        # the S1 a flag draws
    line_numbering_scheme: "{size}-{service}-{sequence}-{spec}"
    line_number_start: 1001       # the 1001 in 6"-P-1001-A1A
    loop_number_start: 101        # where an unnumbered loop starts
    auto_faces: true              # engine picks each movable face
    components: [{name: Water, formula: H2O}]

    units:
      - {kind: Feed, name: Raw Feed, reference: PFD-100,

      - {kind: Feed, name: CWSH, header: true}    # tap it as often

         width: 130, height: 42, port_faces: {inlet: N},
         pin: {x: 680, y: 210, mirrored: y}}
      - {kind: Vessel, name: D-301, supports: skirt}   # what it stands on
      - {kind: Reactor, name: R-201, internals: packing, agitator: null}
      - {kind: Column, name: T-101, internals: valve_tray, trays: 30}

    loops:
      - {variable: L, number: 101}   # a loop draws nothing itself
      - {variable: F}                # no number: takes the next one

    instruments:
      - {type: LIC, number: 101, display: central,
         near: LT-101, at: S, offset: 115, port_faces: {sig_out: W}}
      - {balloon_of: FE-101, at: N, offset: 38}   # the element's own tag

    streams:
      - {from: [Raw Feed, outlet], to: [ST-101, inlet],
         size: '6"', service: P, spec: A1A}
      - {from: [LIC-101, sig_out], to: [FV-101, actuator],
         kind: electric}
      - {from: [FV-200, outlet], to: [M-100, in_2],
         draw_as_recycle: true, tabulate: true,
         properties: {"Temperature (C)": 25 C}}

    stream_table_sections: [[Benzene, Mass Fraction]]
    stream_table: {font_size: 8}
    stream_labels: {enclosure: diamond}
    title_block: {title: ..., revisions: [{rev: A, date: ..., by: AA}]}
    annotations: [{type: equipment_list, align: top-right}]

A unit is addressed by its name, so a symbol drawn more than once -- an
interlock square, a utility header flag -- is addressed by the name the
flowsheet gives each drawing: the first entry is ``I-1``, the second
``I-1 (2)``, in list order. Each entry carries the tag, so a header
tapped twice is written as two ``CWSH`` entries and read back as the
same two taps.
