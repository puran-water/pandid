"""Unit operations and the built-in unit-type library.

Each Unit subclass declares its named ports via the class attribute
``PORTS`` (a list of ``(name, direction, role)`` tuples), or, for
variable-port units, by adding ports in ``__init__``. Ports are exposed
both as a ``ports`` dict and as attributes (``pump.suction``), which
each subclass also annotates (``suction: Port``) so an editor and a type
checker can see them.

A unit whose nozzle count the caller chooses declares the *family*
instead: ``mixer.inlets``, ``splitter.outlets``,
``block.inlets``/``outlets`` and ``column``/``reactor.feeds`` are
``tuple[Port, ...]`` in declaration order. The numbered attributes
(``mixer.in_3``) and ``port("in_3")`` work as well.

This module is also the public ``units`` namespace:
``from pandid import units``.

    #: :meth:`pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.to_dict` therefore writes the

    #:
    #: It is **stiffness, not authority**. The layout fits every claim
    #: at once by weighted least squares
    #: (:mod:`pandid.layout.solver`), so a number here is how strongly a
    #: relationship resists being deformed -- at both of its ends. A
    #: column at 8 authoring six claims is stiff by 48 and barely moves;
    #: twenty neighbours at 2 muster 40 between them and can move it.
    #: Nothing is ever overruled and nothing is ever dropped.
    #:
    #: The ladder the library is written to:
    #:
    #: - **8** a tower or a reactor -- the equipment a sheet is drawn
    #:   around, and the only equipment whose arrangement is a
    #:   convention a reader expects rather than a consequence of what
    #:   it is connected to.
    #: - **4** a vessel, tank or separator: a fixed point on the sheet,
    #:   but one drawn where its train runs.
    #: - **2** an exchanger, pump, compressor or filter: in the train,
    #:   with an opinion about its own two sides and none about the
    #:   sheet.
    #: - **1** (the base) a plain :class:`Block` or anything unlisted:
    #:   it says only what its nozzles and the flow say.
    #: - **0** a valve, a fitting, a reducer, a tee -- these sit *in*
    #:   the line and have no opinion about where the line goes. Their
    #:   claims are dropped entirely rather than weighed at 1, so a
    #:   train with a dozen block valves on it does not stiffen the
    #:   vessel at the end of it by twelve.
    LAYOUT_CONFIDENCE: float = 1

    #: Nozzle name -> where a unit connected to *that nozzle* is drawn
    #: relative to this one: a compass point (``"N"``, ``"NE"``, ...) or
    #: ``(compass point, confidence)`` where one nozzle deserves a
    #: different weight from the rest of the class.
    #:
    #: This is the drafting convention the equipment is drawn to, and
    #: the equipment is the only thing that knows it: a condenser goes
    #: top right of its column because that reads clearly, not because
    #: it stands above it. Vertical position on a P&ID is not elevation,
    #: and no amount of looking at the pipe will say which way up the
    #: tower goes.
    #:
    #: Looked up by the nozzle's own name and then by the family name a
    #: numbered family shares, so ``{"feed": "W"}`` covers ``feed_1``
    #: through ``feed_8``. A nozzle with no entry falls back to the face
    #: the symbol fixed it to, and a unit with neither to flow order --
    #: both at this class's own :attr:`LAYOUT_CONFIDENCE`. See
    #: :mod:`pandid.layout.claims`.
    #:
    #: **Written in the symbol's own frame**, beside the artwork it is
    #: written against, and turned onto the sheet by
    #: :func:`~pandid.portgeom.drawn_direction` when it is read -- so a
    #: unit drawn ``mirrored=True`` states the mirrored arrangement and
    #: an entry never has to be written twice. Read untransformed it was
    #: silently wrong the moment a unit was mirrored, and an entry that
    #: merely restated a face the symbol already fixes was a hazard
    #: rather than a no-op (#471).
    #:
    #: An entry of ``None`` is that fallback **declined**: this nozzle's
    #: face is where the pipe attaches and nothing more, and the class
    #: has no view on where its peer is drawn. Which is what a *service*
    #: connection is -- a heater's steam supply, a filter's regenerant,
    #: a furnace's fuel gas. The header on the other end of it is placed
    #: by where the sheet's utilities come in, not by the machine tapping
    #: it, and reading the nozzle's face instead had five heaters at
    #: confidence 2 asserting their supply lay south of them and sinking
    #: the header below every consumer it fed (#459). Not the same as
    #: leaving the nozzle out: a missing entry reads the face, an entry
    #: of ``None`` says not to.
    #:
    #: Inherited whole, like :attr:`PORT_ANCHORS`: a subclass that
    #: declares its own replaces its base's rather than adding to it, so

    #: it still means.

    #: (``coincident-ports``), because one stream then terminates on top
    #: of another and the sheet cannot be read; :mod:`pandid.layout.faces`
    #: is written so the face selector can never be the thing that makes
    #: one, and :class:`Instrument`'s pool spreads its members over four
    #: faces rather than sharing a point.
    #:
    #: A boundary flag is the case that rule was never about. It is not
    #: a body with nozzles on it -- it is a *pennant*, a mark saying the
    #: material crosses the sheet edge here, and the point is the edge
    #: rather than a nozzle. Two runs meeting it meet it at one place
    #: because there is only one place: the tip of the flag. Nothing is
    #: hidden by them arriving together, since the flag is drawn once
    #: whatever its count.
    #:
    #: A flag, and not "anything that opts in": there is no keyword for
    #: this and it is not meant to grow one. A manifold nozzle on real
    #: equipment is a different question with a different answer (an

        left/right (swapping its E and W faces), ``"y"`` top/bottom
        (swapping N and S), ``"xy"`` both.

        ``port`` names a nozzle, and the coordinates then locate **that
        nozzle** rather than the unit's top-left corner, so
        ``valve.pin(port="inlet", y=run_y)`` puts a valve on a run

        corner and still lands the nozzle on the line. A nozzle you
        name must be what some stated coordinate is measured to, asked
        of the placement this unit ends up with rather than of the call
        in front of us, so ``pin(port="inlet")`` and

        nozzle in it -- and no way of splitting the same arguments
        across two calls gets past it. A rank *beside* a located nozzle
        is not refused: ``pin(col=1, x=5, port="inlet")`` means x locates
        the inlet and supersedes the column there, as a mixed pin always
        has. The face that nozzle is piped from is settled by the pin
        too (see :attr:`pin_`); :meth:`nozzle` still names one outright.

        **On a** :class:`Feed` **or a** :class:`Product` **the nozzle is
        the default**, so ``x``/``y`` place the tip of the flag and
        ``pin(port=...)`` is only ever a way of writing that down. This
        is the one place in the library where ``pin`` means two things:
        every other unit is a box whose corner is somewhere on it, while
        a flag's corner is a coordinate with nothing drawn at it that
        moves as its label grows (see
        :func:`pandid.portgeom.unit_box`). Pass ``port=None`` to place
        that corner anyway -- which is what a placement read back off a
        resolved :class:`~pandid.geometry.Pin` wants.

        **On an attached** :class:`Instrument` **the coordinates still
        place the balloon.** A bubble is furniture hung off a tap point
        and is otherwise positioned from its host (see
        :mod:`pandid.layout.attach`), but an absolute ``x``/``y``
        supersedes that standoff on the axis it names, the way an
        absolute coordinate supersedes a grid rank everywhere else -- so
        ``pin(x=...)`` alone fixes the column the bubble stands in and
        leaves the resolver to find it clear air down the page. The tap
        does not move with it, so the impulse line still leaves the
        point on the line the balloon reads. What a balloon has no
        answer for is a *rank*: it stands in no grid, and ``col``/``row``
        on one is reported by :func:`~pandid.validate.validate` as
        ``pin-not-honored`` rather than drawn (#467).

        Every argument is optional and an omitted one leaves that part
        of the placement as it stands, so a second ``pin(y=...)`` keeps
        the turn and the flip the first call asked for. Pass

    Not a piece of plant. The flag stands for a line crossing the sheet
    edge, and its label identifies the service to the reader.
    ``reference`` is the drawing the line continues onto.

    Being a line and not a box, it is placed by the line: ``pin(x=...,
    y=...)`` puts the flag's *nozzle* there, where the same call puts
    every other unit's top-left corner. See :meth:`Unit.pin`.

    ``header`` says the flag stands for a *utility header* rather than
    for one line: cooling water supply, steam, flare, plant air. A
    header is tapped wherever it is wanted, so it is drawn at each tap
    and labelled the same way every time. See :meth:`repeats`.

    Several lines on one flag
    -------------------------
    **A flag's connection takes as many streams as the sheet gives it,
    and every other nozzle in the library still takes one.** One header
    entering a drawing and serving three users is ordinary, and three
    flags for one header misrepresents the plant; but two pipes on a
    real nozzle *is* a tee, and this package draws one (:class:`Tee`),
    so relaxing the rule there would let an author draw a branch with no
    tee on it -- losing, silently, the thing the drawing exists to
    carry.

    The mechanism is :class:`Instrument`'s signal pool, which is the
    same shape: :meth:`Unit.has_another_port` says the connection is
    plural and :meth:`another_port` hands out the next member, so
    ``fs.connect(feed.outlet, ...)`` twice makes two lines rather than
    raising. What differs is where the members go. A balloon's are
    spread over four faces of a circle and must never coincide; a
    flag's all draw on the flag's **one** nozzle, because that is what
    a flag is -- a single point where the material crosses the sheet
    edge, whatever leaves it on this side. So they are exempt from the
    coincident-nozzle rule, by name and only here; see

class Valve(_NormallyPositioned):
    """Control or let-down valve.

    Two questions, asked separately. ``variant`` is the **body** --
    ``"globe"``, ``"ball"``, ``"butterfly"``, ``"gate"`` and the rest.
    The ``actuator`` argument is **what strokes it**: ``"diaphragm"``,
    ``"motor"``, ``"solenoid"``, ``"hydraulic"`` or ``"handwheel"``, and
    unset for a bare body whose operator the drawing does not state.

    ``variant="control"`` is the shorthand for the common pairing:
    general body, diaphragm actuator::

        units.Valve("HV-101", variant="globe")       # plain globe valve
        units.Valve("CV-303", variant="control")     # control valve
        units.Valve("CV-303", variant="gate", actuator="diaphragm")
        units.Valve("CV-303", variant="control", actuator="diaphragm")
        units.Valve("XV-201", variant="butterfly", actuator="diaphragm")
        units.Valve("SV-401", variant="solenoid")   # = its actuator

    Naming a shorthand's own actuator alongside it is allowed. What is
    refused is a disagreement: ``variant="control", actuator="motor"``
    is two operators and one drawing.

    **The stencil set draws pairings, not parts.** Every actuated valve
    draw.io ships is one fused shape, so there is no loose actuator
    glyph to lay over a globe or a ball and a globe body with a
    diaphragm on it is a drawing that does not exist. The pairings that
    do are :data:`pandid.render.symbols.ACTUATED`, and asking for one
    that is not there raises and names them. What is stored is the
    *variant*.

    ``actuator`` is also the name of the **signal connection** on top of
    the valve, the terminus of a control loop. Being a signal port, it
    takes a signal ``kind`` and refuses process fluid.

    ``normal_position`` is where the valve sits with the plant running:
    ``"open"`` (the default) or ``"closed"``. A closed one is drawn with
    its body **darkened solid** (PIP PIC001 clause 4.2.2.7). The rule is
    one-sided: an open valve is not marked at all, so ``"open"`` draws
    what a valve without the argument draws.

    Where the body cannot carry the fill legibly -- a butterfly's disc,
    a check valve's arrow, a knife gate's blade, all of which the fill
    swallows -- clause 4.2.2.8 writes the abbreviation **NC** instead,
    below the valve on a horizontal run and to the right of it on a
    vertical one. Those variants draw the letters.
    :data:`pandid.render.symbols.NC_DARKENS` lists the ones that darken.

    Clause 4.2.2.10, which bars a control valve and a relief valve
    from being shown NC at all, is enforced: a ``control``,
    ``regulator``, ``relief`` or ``psv`` valve raises rather than
    drawing a mark the standard forbids.

    ISA-5.1 has no valve-fill convention, and its clauses 2.8.1(b)(1),
    2.8.2 and 5.2.5 make it mandatory to declare any symbol extending
    the standard on a legend or cover sheet.
    :func:`pandid.document.legend` builds the box; nothing adds the
    entry for you.

    ``variant="three_way"`` carries a third process nozzle, ``branch``,
    where the symbol's own third leg lands. A three-way body both
    diverts (one inlet, two outlets) and mixes (two inlets, one
    outlet), so no direction is right for both jobs; ``branch`` is
    declared ``"outlet"``, the switching/diverting service the drawing
    is already described as -- the one a run is *switched between*, not
    blended into. Reached by name through
    :class:`~pandid.devices.ThreeWayValve`, or as
    ``Valve(variant="three_way").port("branch")`` on the low-level
    form, since it is not annotated here; see :class:`HeatExchanger`
    for why.

    ``fail`` is a **different question**; see :attr:`fail`.

class _MultiPortVessel(Unit):
    """Shared machinery for :class:`Tank` and :class:`Vessel`: an inlet
    and an outlet, each a family spread across up to four faces --
    :class:`Block`'s mechanism (a ``{port: face}`` dictionary and one
    call to :func:`~pandid.render.symbols.spread` per face), called
    directly rather than wrapped in a
    :class:`~pandid.render.symbols.PortSeries`. A series has one face
    for the whole family, and a tank's inlet has a menu of three;
    :class:`~pandid.render.symbols.Symbol.__post_init__` refuses a port
    claimed by both a series and ``ports``, which is exactly the wall
    this mechanism is built to not hit.

    **The one adaptation.** ``Block`` grows its box to fit a family,
    because a block's size means nothing. A tank or vessel's artwork is
    vendored and its size means something, so this takes
    :func:`~pandid.render.symbols.spread`'s **squeeze** instead -- the
    same fallback a mixer's inlets already reach for when a face runs
    out of room, taken here on purpose rather than as a last resort.

    **Legal faces come from the artwork, not from every compass
    point.** A block's rectangle has no physical constraint, so
    :meth:`Block.nozzle` always succeeds; a tank or vessel's shell only
    has a nozzle where the stencil drew one, so :meth:`nozzle` refuses a
    face the vendored symbol never anchored -- a floating roof's crown,
    say -- exactly as :meth:`Unit.nozzle` always has.

    ``vent``, ``relief`` and ``drain`` are not part of either family:
    each is a single, fixed nozzle, positioned by the artwork's own
    anchor and moved, where the artwork offers an alternative, through
    :meth:`Unit.nozzle`'s ordinary menu -- untouched by any of this.

    Three defaults, each more specific than the last, decide the face a
    connection is drawn on when the caller does not name one:

    1. **The symbol's own anchor** (:meth:`_home_face`) -- the face the
       vendored artwork already puts the nozzle on. The default when
       nothing else speaks, and what keeps every existing sheet exactly
       where it was: the differences between variants (a flat-floored
       tank fills low on the shell, a hopper-bottomed one at the crown)
       are per *drawing*, not per class, and this honours them without
       restating them anywhere.
    2. **A class attribute**, :attr:`DEFAULT_INPUT_FACE` /
       :attr:`DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FACE` -- :class:`Block`'s own mechanism,
       read through ``self.`` so a subclass overrides it. ``None`` on
       :class:`Tank` and :class:`Vessel` themselves, since neither has a
       class-wide opinion; this is where a device class with a
       contextual one -- a reflux drum that always fills at the crown --
       would state it.
    3. **The constructor argument**, ``inputs=``/``outputs=``, which
       always wins.

    """Generic pressure vessel: holdup, not phase separation.

    Variants: ``"default"`` and ``"dished"`` stand upright;
    ``"horizontal"`` is a lying cylinder with dished ends, which is how
    a reflux drum, accumulator or knock-out pot is drawn. Use the
    variant rather than rotating an upright vessel: skirts, saddles and
    shell bands do not survive a quarter turn. ISO 15519-1 §11.4.2 says
    the same, and turning one is reported as ``gravity-turned`` by
    :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.validate`.

    Reach for :class:`Separator` instead when the point of the vessel is
    splitting phases and you want to name the vapour and liquid
    products.

    Besides the process pair a vessel has three connections that are not
    what enters and what leaves: ``vent``, the vapour connection off the
    top head; ``relief``, where the protective device sits; and
    ``drain``, the low-point liquid draw. :class:`Tank` carries the same
    five: a tank and a vessel are one shell at two design pressures, and
    the difference between them is drawn rather than declared.

    **``vent``, ``relief`` and ``drain`` are named, and not counted.**
    Each is positioned by what it is for, and a number carries no duty --
    CHEE4001 p.7 puts the PSV on the protected system itself, upright,
    discharging upward, at the top of the container -- and three
    interchangeable draws have nothing in them that says which is the
    relief.

    Every one of the ten vessel and seven tank stencils anchors a
    coordinate for each of the five, and
    :func:`pandid.portgeom.is_anchored` is true for every one. A nozzle
    the symbol never anchored falls back to the centre of the box, where
    any two of them land on each other -- issue #225 is that failure.
    ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py`` holds the seventeen port maps.

    The cost is that a *second* relief is a change to the artwork rather
    than a number. Nothing here is reported by ``nozzle-unconnected``,
    which reads only numbered nozzles; see issue #215 for drawing a
    spare nozzle blanked.

    **The process pair is a family, and may be.** ``inputs=``/
    ``outputs=`` give a vessel more than one connection, exactly as
    :class:`Block`'s do -- a count (every one on the same face) or one
    face per connection, e.g. ``inputs=["W", "W", "N"]`` for a knock-out
    pot taking a high-level fill against a recycle return. Left alone,
    ``inputs=1, outputs=1`` is what every vessel has always had: a
    single ``inlet``, a single ``outlet``, on the face the artwork
    anchors -- see :class:`_MultiPortVessel` for the three levels that
    decide it and :meth:`~_MultiPortVessel.nozzle` for how a face is
    moved. Above one, the numbered spelling takes over: ``in_1``,
    ``in_2`` ... in declaration order, reachable through
    :attr:`inlets`.

    What it stands on
    -----------------
    ``supports=`` names one of the four ISO 10628-2 group-26 apparatus
    elements and draws it under or against the shell::

        Vessel("D-301", supports="skirt")     # 26.3 C2007
        Vessel("D-302", supports="leg")       # 26.1 C2005, a pair
        Vessel("D-303", supports="bracket")   # 26.2 C2006, a pair
        Vessel("D-304", supports="ring")      # 26.4 C2008, a pair

    That is what ISO group 1 items 1.16 to 1.19 are: one vessel outline
    and one group-26 element each, composed. It works on **every** vessel
    variant, which the two variants it replaces did not -- a jacketed
    vessel could not stand on legs, because ``variant=`` had already been
    spent on the jacket.

    # this class instead and ``vessel.inlets[i]`` / ``vessel.port(...)``.

class Tank(_MultiPortVessel):
    """Storage tank.

    Variants: ``"default"`` (dished roof), ``"conical"``,
    ``"floating_roof"``, ``"sphere"``, and three named for a cone at the
    bottom: ``"conical_bottom"``, ``"conical_ends"``,
    ``"dished_roof_conical_bottom"``.

    A tank's five nozzles are :class:`Vessel`'s five, for the reason
    given there. Two of them are what a storage tank exists to have:

    - **``vent``, the conservation vent.** A fixed-roof tank fills,
      empties and warms through the day, and it breathes through a roof
      nozzle that is neither the fill nor the draw. Ordinary practice;
      no document on disk covers tank venting, arrestors or floating
      roofs.
    - **``relief``, the fire-case relief on the sphere.** CHEE4001 p.8
      has it protect a pressure vessel against fire or another outside
      source of heat, on a vessel carrying no permanent supply
      connection. A separate nozzle from the vent because one passes
      something on every fill and the other nothing until the design
      case.

    Whether a given tank really has all five is the sheet's business: a
    declared nozzle is *offered*, and choosing not to pipe one is a
    drawing decision.

    **Where a tank fills** is a menu and not a fixture (issue #226). The
    four flat-floored variants -- ``default``, ``conical``,
    ``floating_roof`` and the sphere -- anchor the fill low on the
    shell, since splash-filling a flammable liquid into a vapour space
    generates static; the three hopper-bottomed ones keep the crown,
    because a silo is filled over the top. Every variant offers both,
    through the same :meth:`~_MultiPortVessel.nozzle` call every other
    unit takes::

        tk = Tank("TK-602")          # fills low on the shell
        tk.nozzle("inlet", "N")      # ...through a crown downcomer

    ``floating_roof`` offers no crown placement at all: the roof rides
    on the liquid, so ``nozzle("inlet", "N")`` raises. The sphere's
    crown carries two drawn nozzles and both are spoken for; see #225
    and ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py``.

    A tank with no ``nozzle()`` call gets its face chosen by layout from
    where the peer landed (:mod:`pandid.layout.faces`), as a drum's
    inlet does.

    **A tank fed by several streams** takes ``inputs=``, exactly as
    :class:`Vessel` does -- a high-level fill against a recycle return,
    say::

        Tank("TK-901", inputs=["W", "W", "N"])
        tk.in_1, tk.in_2, tk.in_3   # west, west, crown; in declared order

    Left at ``inputs=1`` (the default), ``in_1`` keeps the bare alias
    ``inlet`` and every existing sheet is unchanged. ``outputs=`` is
    offered for the same reason :class:`Vessel`'s is, and defaults to
    one outlet the same way.

    the small end sits on a different centreline from the large one; see

    =====================  ========================================

class Tee(Unit):

    A bypass leg around a control valve, a drain off the underside of a
    run, a vent off the top, a sample point, a PSV takeoff: every one of
    them is a line splitting in two, and this is the fitting that splits
    it. Not a unit operation -- a :class:`Mixer` or :class:`Splitter` is
    a piece of plant, drawn as a triangle and scheduled as one.

    A tee is drawn as **nothing at all**: three lines meeting, the run
    passing straight through unbroken and the branch leaving it at a
    right angle, so ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` sit on one centreline. That
    includes the **arrowhead** a PFD draws at the end of a process line:
    a line ending at a tee is drawn without a head, so no filled
    triangle lands in the middle of an unbroken run. A line *leaving* a
    tee takes its head at its own destination.

    **It carries no tag.** A tee is a bulk piping item specified by the
    piping class, and an issued sheet writes nothing against it. The
    flowsheet still needs a name, so ``name`` defaults to
    :data:`DEFAULT_NAME` and any two tees may share it
    (:meth:`repeats`); :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.add` hands out
    ``TEE (2)``, ``TEE (3)``. Nothing reaches the equipment list either:
    ``"tee"`` is not in ``pandid.document._MAJOR_EQUIPMENT``.

    ``branch`` says which way the third connection runs: ``"outlet"``
    (the default) takes flow off the run, which is the takeoff end of a
    bypass and every drain, vent and sample point; ``"inlet"`` returns
    flow to it. The run is always ``inlet`` to ``outlet``.

    The branch leaves the **south** face as drawn, so the side it comes
    off is the tee's placement, stated with :meth:`~Unit.pin`:

    ===================  ================
    ``pin(...)``         run, branch
    ===================  ================
    (nothing)            W to E, branch S
    ``mirrored="y"``     W to E, branch N
    ``orientation=90``   N to S, branch W
    ``orientation=270``  S to N, branch E
    ===================  ================

    The run keeps its stream or line number straight through a tee, as
    it does through a valve or a reducer, and the branch starts a number
    of its own. Set ``new_line_number`` to break the run's number where
    the piping class changes at the junction.

class Filter(Unit):
    """Filter (liquid or gas), in three shapes of nozzle set.

    **Clarifying** is the default and the plain reading of the word: one
    in, one out. The solids are held in the medium and taken out offline
    when it is changed, backwashed or blown down, so nothing leaves the
    symbol but the filtrate. ``default`` (bag, candle or cartridge
    elements), ``fixed_bed`` and the three gas casings ``gas``,
    ``gas_fixed_bed`` and ``gas_belt`` are all of them.

    **Cake-forming** is the other half of the family, and it is two
    streams more::

        Filter("F-101", variant="press")
          .inlet      slurry in
          .wash_in    wash water in
          .outlet     filtrate out
          .cake       cake out

    A press separates a slurry into **two products**, and the cake is
    the one it is bought for. Drawing it as the filtrate is the sheet
    saying the solids leave in the liquid line, which is the opposite of
    what the machine does. ``wash_in`` is the **displacement wash** that
    pushes mother liquor out of the cake before it is discharged --
    standard on a plate-and-frame press, on a rotary drum vacuum filter
    (sprays over the drum) and on a belt filter (discrete wash zones),
    which is exactly the four variants that carry it: ``press``,
    ``belt``, ``rotary`` and ``rotary_scraper``.

    **``ion_exchange`` is neither**, because what it takes is not wash
    water. A resin bed is restored by running acid, caustic or brine
    through it, and what comes back out is that reagent loaded with the
    ions it has stripped: ``regenerant_in`` and ``spent_regenerant``.
    Calling either of those a wash would put the wrong fluid on the
    line list and the wrong material on the pipe spec.

    Both extra nozzles are **offered, not required**. A sheet that pipes
    the cake and leaves the wash open draws three lines and no fourth,
    and :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.validate` says nothing about
    it: an unconnected nozzle a class declares is a drawing decision,
    and only a *numbered* one is a count that has to be met.

    discharges its solids from; a decanter clarifying a brine wants its
    ``overflow`` and one dewatering a mineral slurry wants its

    **Bare ``Centrifuge(...)`` draws the decanter**, item 9.6 X8082, and

    :class:`CrushingMachine` has an unspecified drawing to reach and this
    class does not. Of the eight, the continuous screw-type decanter is
    the one a solid-liquid separation duty on a slurry, sludge or cake
    reaches for most often, so it is the drawing an author gets free and
    every other row is named explicitly.

    **The same three nozzles on every row.** All eight draw the same
    shape of connection -- a feed and a pair of draws -- so unlike
    :class:`Filter`'s cake-forming variants, no variant here adds or
    removes a nozzle; only where each lands on the drawing changes
    between them. See
    ``pandid.render.symbols.SymbolRegistry._register_centrifuges``.

    **Not gravity-fixed.** A centrifuge's floor is drawn low and its feed
    high, the way a hopper's or a settling vessel's is, but what does the
    separating is rotation and not a free surface or a settling body, so
    it may be turned or mirrored to fit a layout exactly as ISO 15519-1

    built on this class rather than beside it. ISO's own item means "a

    Once the machine is chosen, :class:`Crusher` or :class:`Mill` draws
    it and ``variant=`` says which characteristic -- both take every
    keyword this class does, since both are it with a mark added.

    Two nozzles, and the same two on every row of the group, because
    Table 2 draws the same two connection ticks on all thirteen: one on

    the two units either side of that chute should not call the same
    thing by two words.

    **There is no ``drive``**, and it is worth saying why rather than
    leaving it to be noticed. Every one of these is motor-driven, and
    ISO draws exactly one motor in the whole of Table 2: item 1.27 X8006,
    the stirred vessel, where the motor sits on the agitator's own shaft
    and the standard registers the composition. Group 11 draws no motor
    and no third tick, so a ``drive`` here would be a nozzle pandid
    invented, on a body ISO has already said how to connect. An author

    small rollers and a short one on big rollers are both drawings.

    The symbol is *built* to the pair rather than scaled to a box, so a

        as they go away from the symbol's centre line. So a high
        alarm on a controller is lettering beside that controller, not a
        balloon of its own, and no line is drawn: an annotation is not a
        signal.

        §5.1.3, p. 19, names the four quadrants Figure 8 puts them in,
        and this method's four arguments are that list in its order:

        - ``safety`` -- (a) a reference to a typical diagram, or safety
          information such as a SIL or SIF identifier;
        - ``variable`` -- (b) which variable is meant where the tag uses
          letter code U for multivariable: pH, µS, MJ/s;
        - ``high`` -- (c) a high output or input function, an alarm or a
          switching action say;
        - ``low`` -- (d) the same for a low one.

        The quadrants are the corners, which is the clause's own reason
        for them: keeping the four faces clear is what lets the symbol
        be connected horizontally and vertically. So annotating a
        balloon spends no face.

        Each takes one code or several. Several are ordered A, S then Z
        outward whatever order they are given in, since the standard
        fixes the sequence and the author has no choice to express::

class Evaporator(Unit):
    """Evaporator: liquor concentrated by boiling water off it.

    **Not a :class:`HeatExchanger`, and the nozzles are why.** An
    exchanger has two sides and four connections; an evaporator has a
    heated side, a feed, a concentrate and -- the whole reason it is on
    the sheet -- a **vapour** that is a stream of the plant, piped to the
    next effect, to a condenser or to a barometric leg. The library drew
    one as ``HeatExchanger(variant="kettle")`` until 0.1.4 and
    ``examples/21_alumina_refinery`` said in its own source what that
    cost: a kettle body "is the nearest drawing ISO has to an effect of a
    falling-film train", which is a sentence about a substitution rather
    than about a symbol.

    Five nozzles, in two groups. ``feed``, ``vapor`` and ``concentrate``
    are the process: liquor in, water out of the crown, strong liquor out
    of the bottom. ``heating_in`` and ``condensate`` are the steam chest,
    drawn on the shell walls between the two tubesheets -- named for what
    lands on them, which is :class:`HeatExchanger`'s own principle, and
    ``condensate`` rather than ``heating_out`` because what leaves a
    steam chest is condensate whether the steam came from a boiler or
    from the effect before this one.

    **The chest is fed from the west and drained to the east**, which is
    a fact about *trains* rather than about chests. A multiple-effect
    train is drawn left to right and every effect is heated by the one
    before it, so an effect's vapour leaves its crown going east and has
    to arrive at the next effect's ``heating_in``. Drawn on the same wall
    as the drain it would have to go round the body to get there.

    Variants
    --------
    ::

        Evaporator("EV-101")                            # element unspecified
        Evaporator("EV-102", variant="calandria")       # short-tube
        Evaporator("EV-103", variant="falling_film")
        Evaporator("EV-104", variant="climbing_film")
        Evaporator("EV-105", variant="plate")

    ``default`` draws the two tubesheets around a plain boxed element,
    which is what an early PFD knows: the duty is sized, the element is
    not picked. ISO's own item 11.1 X8084 general crushing machine is the
    same row for the same stage of design.

    ``falling_film`` and ``climbing_film`` are one body drawn twice,
    because the machines differ in where the liquor enters -- onto a
    distributor over the tubes, or into the foot of them -- and that is a
    nozzle rather than a marking. The distributor is drawn on the first
    and not the second, since a climbing-film evaporator has none.

    **There is no forced-circulation variant.** One is drawn on a real
    sheet as three tagged items: this body, the circulating heater and
    the pump between them, all three scheduled and sized separately. See
    :meth:`~pandid.render.symbols.SymbolRegistry._register_evaporators`.

    What holds it up
    ----------------
    ``supports=`` names one of the four ISO group-26 apparatus elements
    to draw under the shell -- ``"leg"``, ``"bracket"``, ``"skirt"`` or
    ``"ring"`` -- exactly as :class:`Vessel` takes it, and for the same
    reason it is a keyword there rather than a variant: a support is
    present or absent on the *same* machine, and which one a body stands
    on says nothing about what the body does. A falling-film effect is a
    tall shell that stands on a skirt::

        Evaporator("EV-101", variant="falling_film", supports="skirt")

    It is the one composition keyword this class takes. The heating
    element cannot be a second, however much it looks like one: groups 26
    to 29 draw no tube bundle, no calandria and no plate pack, and a part
    that cannot name the Table 2 row it is has nothing to justify it (see
    :class:`~pandid.render.symbols.IsoPart`). So the element is the
    variant and the support is the layer, which is the split the
    standard's own vocabulary makes rather than one this class invented.

    Every variant is drawn one way up and reported as ``gravity-turned``
    by :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.validate` if turned: vapour
    leaves the crown and concentrate the bottom, ISO 15519-1 §11.4.2's
    exception for a symbol where gravity is a functionality.

    ``rake=None`` is a real machine and not a bare body: a settling tank
    or gravity settler with no mechanism in it, which is what small
    duties and API separators use, and it is the drawing the vendored
    stencil is of before anything is composed onto it.

    **The drive is not drawn**, and that is deliberate. ISO's licence to
    draw a motor inside another apparatus is item 1.27 X8006 and that row
    alone -- a stirred vessel -- so a motor over this body would be an
    apparatus inside an apparatus with nothing tabulated behind it. A
    rake drive that has to appear on the sheet is drawn beside the
    thickener and tagged. See
    :func:`~pandid.render.iso_parts.rake_overlays`.

    Drawn one way up, and reported as ``gravity-turned`` by
    :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.validate` if turned: the weir is
    at the rim and the cone is under the floor.

#:    There is no cone-bottomed agitated vessel in the standard, so this
#:    variant reproduces no tabulated item.
#: 2. **It spends ``variant=`` on the contents, on the one row where that word
#:    is already contested.** :data:`Reactor._STIRRED` has to exclude it
#:    precisely because the stirrer is in the artwork and a composed one would
#:    make two -- so a ``mixing`` reactor cannot take a stirrer of its own,
#:    cannot be jacketed, and cannot hold a bed or trays. That is the failure
#:    the four keywords were added to end.
#: 3. **Its drawn motor connects to nothing.** The agitator resolves to
#:    ``None`` here, so no ``drive`` is ever added, and the sheet shows a
#:    driver an author cannot route power to. ``Reactor(agitator='disc')``
#:    draws the motor *and* the nozzle.

    ISO 10628-2 has no reactor group and no reactor symbol. What it has

        Reactor("R-102", agitator="turbine")

        Reactor("R-201", internals="packing")         # a PBR
        Reactor("R-202", internals="fluidised_bed")   # a FBR
        Reactor("R-301", variant="tubular")           # a PFR

    - ``agitator=`` names one of the ten ISO group-28 stirrers:
      ``"agitator"`` (the general one, and the default on a stirred
      body), ``"turbine"``, ``"propeller"``, ``"anchor"``, ``"helical"``,
      ``"flat_blade"``, ``"gate_paddle"``, ``"cross_beam"``,
      ``"impeller"``, ``"disc"``. It hangs from the top head on a shaft
      through it, and the shaft runs up to the **drive motor** -- ISO
      item 20.6 C0082, drawn above the vessel, which is what carries the
      ``drive`` connection. Stirrer and motor come together because ISO
      item 1.27 X8006 draws them together: there is no tabulated stirred
      vessel with nothing turning it, so there is no keyword to ask for
      one.
    - ``internals=`` names one of the eight ISO group-27 internals. Two
      of them make a reactor a different reactor: ``"packing"`` is a
      packed bed and ``"fluidised_bed"`` is a fluidised bed.

    Either may be ``None``, which draws that much of the shell bare.

    **Naming internals leaves out the agitator**, because a packed bed,
    a fluidised bed and a set of trays are all ways of not being a
    stirred tank. Name one anyway where the vessel really has both --
    ``Reactor("R-203", agitator="turbine", internals="packing")`` is a
    stirred slurry reactor and is drawn with the stirrer in the bed.

    ``variant=`` chooses the **body**: ``"default"`` the dished-end
    stirred tank, ``"jacketed"`` the same inside a heating jacket,
    ``"tubular"`` the horizontal shell of a plug-flow reactor, and
    ``"mixing"`` the rectangle-with-a-V-bottom that ``"default"`` used to
    draw.

class Separator(Unit):
    """Flash drum or phase separator.

    Variants: ``"default"`` is the plain dished-head vertical cylinder,
    the same shell :class:`Vessel` and :class:`Column` are drawn from.
    ``"horizontal"`` is a lying cylinder with dished ends, sharing its
    stencil with ``Vessel(variant="horizontal")``. Use it rather than
    turning the upright one, as a vessel does.

    ``"knockout"`` adds two internals to the upright drum: a demister
    pad and a level gauge, both drawn into the equipment artwork. The
    gauge is *drawn*, not declared, so a level instrument added with
    :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.add_instrument` puts its own
    balloon beside it rather than replacing it, and the sheet says the
    level is measured twice.

    ``"cyclone"``, ``"gravity"``, ``"scrubber"`` and ``"electrostatic"``
    are the separating bodies that are not drums at all.

    **The draws are named for what leaves, not for the shape of the
    body.** Four variants keep ``vapor`` and ``liquid``, and they are
    the ones where the two really are phases disengaging: the drum in
    its three drawings, and the wet scrubber.

    The other seven draw ``overflow``, high on the body, and
    ``underflow``, out of the apex: the four **mechanical** separators
    (``"sifter"``, ``"impact"``, ``"permanent_magnet"``,
    ``"electromagnetic"``), which sort by size, inertia or magnetism,
    and the three **dust collectors** (``"cyclone"``, ``"gravity"``,
    ``"electrostatic"``), whose catch is a hopper full of solids. The
    pair names the two *positions* the artwork draws. Neither name says
    which of the two is the product: a cyclone on a spray dryer recovers
    its product from the underflow, and the identical cyclone on a vent
    line throws that same catch away.

    The three collectors called their catch ``vapor`` and ``liquid`` up
    to 0.1.1, ``overflow`` and ``underflow`` since 0.1.2. The old pair
    is gone as of 0.1.3: a sheet written against it raises.

    Every variant is drawn one way up and reported as ``gravity-turned``
    by :meth:`~pandid.flowsheet.Flowsheet.validate` if turned, which is
    ISO 15519-1 §11.4.2's exception for symbols where gravity is a
    functionality.

    How it separates
    ----------------
    ``characteristic=`` names one of the three ISO 10628-2 group-29
    internal characteristics the standard composes a separating vessel
    from -- the mark inside the body that says what does the work::

        Separator("V-201", characteristic="gravity")          # 8.3 X8031
        Separator("V-202", characteristic="electrostatic")    # 8.6 X8125
        Separator("V-203", characteristic="electromagnetic")  # 8.8 X8126

    Three, and only three, because those are the three group-8 rows whose
    every mark is a numbered part. **A cyclone is not one of them**: it
    is X2618, a registered symbol in its own right whose helical vortex
    appears nowhere in group 29, so it stays ``variant="cyclone"``. So do
    the sifter, the impact separator, the permanent magnet and the
    scrubber.

    More than one feed
    ------------------
    ``n_feeds`` gives the body more than one charge nozzle, the way it
    does on :class:`Column` and :class:`Reactor`. A wash-water gravity
    separator takes its wash beside the feed it is washing; a flare
    knock-out drum takes a header per relief system; a scrubber takes
    its make-up separately from the gas it cleans::

        Separator("V-401", n_feeds=2, characteristic="gravity")

    They are ``feed_1`` ... ``feed_n``, spread down the wall in
    declaration order so ``feed_1`` is the highest, and the single-feed
    separator keeps the plain ``feed`` as an alias for ``feed_1``. On
    the hopper-bottomed bodies the family grows **downwards** from the
    coordinate the one feed was always drawn at, rather than straddling
    it, so adding a second feed to an existing sheet does not move the
    first; see :data:`pandid.render.symbols.FROM_START`.

    ``variant="horizontal"`` is the one drawing that refuses a second
    feed, and it refuses it for a reason about the artwork rather than
    about the plant -- see :attr:`_ONE_FEED_VARIANTS`.
    """

    # The phase draws only, since ``_VARIANT_PORTS`` defaults to
    # ``_PHASES``. ``overflow`` and ``underflow`` are absent: seven of
    # the eleven variants have them *instead of* ``vapor`` and
    # ``liquid``, never as well, so declaring all four would tell a
    # checker a plain flash drum has an ``overflow``. They belong on a
    # per-variant subclass, which ``pandid.devices`` is; off it, reach

class Column(Unit):
    """A general tower: one dished-end shell, fed at one end and drawn from
    both.

    Every column has a feed, an ``overhead`` product off the top and
    ``bottoms`` off the bottom -- and nothing else, because nothing about
    those three assumes the tower boils. :class:`DistillationColumn` adds
    the reflux loop and the reboiler a *distillation* column has;
    :class:`Stripper` adds the reboiler alone; :class:`Absorber` adds
    neither, because an absorber is a general tower with an honest name.
    This class is their common base for exactly that reason -- the
    :class:`Separator` shape, one base carrying what every subclass has
    and nothing narrower -- so ``t: Column`` accepts any of the four and
    a checker never sees a nozzle a plain ``Column`` does not build.

    A plain ``Column(...)`` is still what an author writes for equipment
    that never had a reflux loop -- a scrubber, an adsorber, a molecular
    sieve -- and ``col.reflux_in``/``.boilup_in``/``.reboiler_duty``/
    ``.condenser_duty`` still work for one release where an existing sheet
    reaches for them on a tower that should have been built as a
    :class:`DistillationColumn`, with a warning naming the class to move
    to. ``col.distillate`` still works the same way, everywhere it used
    to, warning towards ``.overhead``.

    ``n_feeds`` gives the tower more than one feed nozzle: an extractive
    distillation takes its solvent above the feed tray, an azeotropic
    tower its entrainer. They are ``feed_1`` ... ``feed_n``, spread down
    the shell in declaration order, so ``feed_1`` is the highest; the
    single-feed column keeps the plain ``feed``.

    ``n_draws`` gives it a side draw: a sidestream tower -- a crude
    atmospheric column, a solvent recovery train, any three-product
    fractionation -- pulls a third product off the shell between the two
    ends. Unlike a feed, none is the ordinary case, so it defaults to
    zero and the family is ``draw`` / ``draw_1`` ... ``draw_n`` on the
    shell's **east** face, opposite the feeds -- a draw is a feed's flow
    reversed. It places a nozzle only: a real draw is vapour or liquid
    and the two leave different nozzles on a real sheet, but a feed does
    not distinguish that either, so doing it for a draw alone would be
    inconsistent. The phase belongs on the port's ``role``, not on its
    placement, and nothing here draws above-or-below-the-tray geometry
    for it. A pumparound is a draw at one stage and an ordinary feed
    carrying the return at another -- two nozzles, wired with a plain
    ``connect()`` and no paired abstraction for it, the same way reflux
    is not one either.

    What is inside it
    -----------------
    **A column is drawn bare; ``internals=`` furnishes it.** ISO
    10628-2's group 2 is not a separate vocabulary of towers; it is one
    dished-end shell carrying one group-27 internal, drawn N times. The
    standard's own general column is item 2.1 X8100 and it carries
    nothing; the tray tower is the *separate* item 2.2 X8101. So a
    column nobody has furnished draws the first of those, not the
    second::

        Column("T-101")                                    # a bare shell
        Column("T-102", internals="tray")                  # a tray tower
        Column("T-103", internals="bubble_cap_tray", trays=12)
        Column("T-104", internals="valve_tray", trays=30)
        Column("T-105", internals="packing", trays=2)      # two beds

    The eight names are ISO's: ``"tray"`` (27.1), ``"baffle_tray"``,
    ``"bubble_cap_tray"``, ``"valve_tray"``, ``"sieve_tray"``,
    ``"filter_insert"``, ``"fluidised_bed"`` and ``"packing"``.

    ``trays=`` counts whatever ``internals=`` names: decks for a deck,
    beds for a bed, and nothing at all where ``internals`` is ``None``.
    The default is :data:`DEFAULT_TRAYS`, the eight of ISO item 2.6
    X8011.

    An absorber, a stripper, a scrubbing tower, an adsorber and a
    molecular sieve are **not distinct drawings** and ISO gives them no
    symbols. Each is this shell carrying whichever internal it really
    contains, told apart by its tag.

    Where a feed enters
    -------------------
    Left alone, ``n_feeds`` nozzles spread evenly down the shell -- a
    placement with no process meaning. ``feed_stages=`` says which stage
    each feed actually enters on, in the same count ``trays=`` gives::

        Column("T-101", internals="valve_tray", trays=30,
               n_feeds=2, feed_stages=[12, 22])

    One entry per feed, in declaration order, top of the shell to bottom.
    ``None`` in place of a stage leaves that one feed on the even spread,
    so ``feed_stages=[12, None]`` pins the solvent and leaves the main
    feed exactly where it always was. A stage is 1 at the top of the
    shell to ``trays`` at the bottom -- the same numbering the tray count
    itself is given in -- and a stage the column does not have is
    refused, naming the count it does. Naming a stage on a column with
    no ``internals=`` is refused too: there is nothing on the shell for a
    reader to count against.

    Where a draw leaves
    --------------------
    ``draw_stages=`` puts a draw on the stage it actually leaves from --
    the identical mechanism, read in the other direction::

        Column("T-301", internals="valve_tray", trays=30,
               n_draws=1, draw_stages=[15])

    One entry per draw, in the same declaration order, and every rule
    ``feed_stages=`` follows above applies unchanged: ``None`` keeps the
    even spread, a stage out of range names the count the column really
    has, and a stage named on a bare shell is refused for the reason a
    feed's is.

    # a column with more than one of *both* a feed and a draw is rare,
    # and a checker that cannot resolve ``feed_2`` on it has lost nothing
    # ``t: Column`` did not already accept.
    #
    # So this is two independent overload families instead, each
    # covering the case that is actually common:
    #
    # - **any n_feeds, n_draws=0** (the ordinary column, drawing no
    #   side stream at all) -- ``Column1`` .. ``Column8``, exactly as
    #   before this class had a second count;
    # - **n_feeds=1, any n_draws** (a plain tower with one side draw)
    #   -- ``ColumnDraw1`` .. ``ColumnDraw8``.
    #
    # A call naming *both* counts above one matches neither family and
    # falls through to the last, untyped overload, which hands back the
    # plain ``Column``: every nozzle it really has is still reachable
    # through ``col.feeds``/``col.draws`` or ``col.port(...)``, just not
    # by the numbered attribute spelling. That is the same trade
    # :class:`Reactor` and :class:`Mixer` already take for a *computed*
    # count -- honest rather than restrictive, since nothing about
    # ``n_feeds=2, n_draws=2`` is a literal a checker could not in
    # principle have resolved, only one this class declines to spend 64
    # classes resolving.
    #
    # This still catches every typo the single-family version did:
    # neither family reaches for a blanket ``__getattr__`` the way
    # :class:`Block` does, because a column carries fixed nozzles worth
    # catching a misspelling on and a block carries almost none -- see
    # :class:`Block`'s own comment on that trade, and
    # ``tests/test_port_annotations.py``'s ``_CHECKER_VISIBLE_GETATTR``,
    # which pins that ``Block`` is still the only class paying it.
    # :attr:`_RETIRED_PORTS`/:attr:`_RETIRED_PORT_ALIASES` are a
    # different mechanism from both: they answer through
    # :meth:`Unit.__getattr__`, which stays hidden from a checker, so
    # ``col.reflux_in`` still raises at edit time on a plain ``Column``
    # even though it still works at run time.

    #: north too, so read off the faces the pair states that each is
    #: above the other, which is no statement at all and left the tower
    #: to be drawn upside down by whatever had an opinion next.
    #:
    #: North *east* rather than north, and south *east* rather than
    #: south, so the overhead system and the reboiler loop each get a
    #: column of their own and the tower's west side stays clear for the
    #: feed.
    #:
    #: The two **returns** are north east and south east for the same
    #: reason the two draws are, and it has to be the same answer: the
    #: reflux comes back from the drum the overhead went to and the
    #: boilup from the reboiler the bottoms went to, so ``reflux_in: N``
    #: beside ``overhead: NE`` is the tower asserting that one cluster
    #: is in two places.
    #:
    #: **These two entries do very little, and the reason is worth
    #: knowing before anyone tunes them.** 13 of the 17 ``reflux_in`` and
    #: ``boilup_in`` connections in the shipped corpus are the run the
    #: cycle breaker tore, and a return line is read for the pipe alone
    #: (:mod:`pandid.layout.claims`) -- ``PLACES`` never sees it. What is
    #: left is four connections, and switching both entries to the
    #: ``N``/``S`` of the approved design moves the corpus by **six**
    #: crossings, 246 to 252, all of them on ``20_molecular_sieve_dryer``,
    #: measured with ``scripts/layout_quality.py``. The consistency
    #: argument above is the whole of the case for them;

    # a time. A generated class per arity would not help either, since

    # a ``Port`` and ``len(m.inlets)`` is honest. **It is indexed from
    # zero while the nozzles are numbered from one**: ``m.inlets[0]`` is
    # ``in_1``.
    #
    # Where the number is wanted, ``m.in_3`` is the plain spelling and

    *Compression*, *Product Recovery* -- with the streams between them
    named and nothing inside them drawn. It carries no equipment
    vocabulary: no suction, no bottoms, no vent. It has connections, and
    the only thing the drawing says about one is which side it is on.

    ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` are **one face per connection**, in
    order, and a plain count is the shorthand for the common case:
    ``inputs=3`` is three on the west, ``outputs=2`` two on the east.
    The nozzles are ``in_1`` ... ``in_n`` and ``out_1`` ... ``out_m``,
    numbered across the whole family rather than per face.

    Those two arguments are named for what they *declare*; the accessors
    are named for what they *return*: :attr:`inlets` and :attr:`outlets`
    are the connections, :attr:`input_faces` and :attr:`output_faces`
    the sides they are on.

    **A face is a placement, and the engine reads it.** A connection on
    the north puts its peer in the row above and in the same column, one
    on the south puts it below, so a block flow diagram lays itself out
    without a coordinate anywhere. See :mod:`pandid.layout.claims`.
    ``examples/12_block_flow_diagram.py`` is pinned all the same: a
    hand-placed BFD says which sections the reader takes in a row, which
    is not something the ranking can know.

    **A face names the box's own side, not the reader's.** ``"N"`` is
    the top of the block as declared; a :meth:`pin` that turns or
    mirrors it moves the box and every connection with it, so that
    connection is drawn on the east of a block turned a quarter. This is
    where :meth:`nozzle` differs from :meth:`Unit.nozzle`.
    :func:`pandid.portgeom.port_faces` answers about the finished sheet.

    **The box sizes itself to what it carries.** A family squeezed to
    fit a fixed box draws arrowheads that touch and read as one blob, so
    the height follows the west and east counts and the width follows
    the north and south ones, at a pitch derived from the arrowhead the
    renderer draws (:data:`~pandid.render.symbols.BLOCK_PITCH`). The
    width also clears the name, which a BFD letters inside the box.

    ``width``/``height`` still win where they are given, and a box too
    small to draw the connections at that pitch is **refused** wherever
    it is asked for: the constructor, a later assignment, :meth:`nozzle`
    and :meth:`pin`, the last of which is where a quarter turn can put a
    run on the shorter axis.

    A width the author gave also wins over the name, which then hangs
    out of both ends of the box. The name is written on an opaque halo,
    so an overhanging one **erases whatever is drawn beside it**. Leave
    ``width`` off and it cannot happen.

    **Variants**: none.

        A block otherwise draws the connections on a face in declaration
        order, inputs before outputs. This is the only thing that says
        otherwise: :meth:`nozzle` chooses the *side*, and re-declaring a
        connection onto the side it is already on leaves it where it
        was.

        **First is the low end of the face, on the box's own axes.**
        West on a north or south face, north on a west or east one --
        the direction :attr:`inlets` is numbered in and
        :func:`~pandid.render.symbols.spread` lays a family out in. Like
        the face itself it is the box's own order, so a :meth:`pin` that
        mirrors the block draws the same first member on the right of
        the sheet.

        A connection :meth:`nozzle` moves onto the face *afterwards*
        takes its place in declaration order rather than joining the
        end. Order the face once it has the members it is going to have.

        Raises :class:`ValueError` for a connection that is not on
        ``face``, one named twice, one belonging to another unit, or a
        list that leaves any of the face's connections unplaced, and
        leaves the block untouched when it does.
