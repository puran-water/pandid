"""Generate pandid/render/_vendored_symbols.py from draw.io (jgraph/drawio) P&ID
stencils (Apache-2.0). See NOTICE for attribution.

Each mapped symbol is converted from mxGraph stencil XML to plain SVG by
scripts/mxgraph_to_svg.py, and its ports are resolved either from the stencil's
named <constraint> anchors ("W"/"E"/"N"/"S"/...) or placed explicitly on a
bounding-box edge as ``(edge, along)`` for shapes that lack a needed anchor.

The shape's ``aspect`` comes across with it, as ``Symbol.stretchable``: the
stencil author already answered whether the drawing may be reshaped to fill a
box of another shape (``variable``) or has to keep its proportions (``fixed``),
and that is the same question a unit given an explicit width and height asks.
It is named in each emitted symbol's comment, and only a ``fixed`` shape carries
the keyword, since stretchable is the default on both sides.

``ADAPTED_ELSEWHERE`` records the stencil-derived symbols this generator cannot
emit (the parametric ones) and where they are written instead.

``STENCIL_PATCHES`` records the corrections applied to the vendored stencils on
the way through, for the shapes draw.io draws wrongly. The vendored XML stays
exactly as vendored; the correction is written in the stencil's own language
here, so the deviation from upstream is in this file rather than hidden in a
mirrored data file.

    # SCALE for the box it comes out at.
    #

    # out the other at mid-height, with the vapour connection on the crown of
    # the top head at (50, 0). Switching a vessel between variants is a change
    # of artwork, not of piping, so the two must offer the same nozzles in the
    # same places. Both process nozzles are at mid-height, which is on the
    # straight shell (it spans y 15..185) at any box the unit is drawn at,
    # rather than on a head, where the ink curves away from the box edge.
    #
    # ``relief`` and ``drain`` are the two nozzles issue #222 added to Vessel
    # and Tank, and every one of the eighteen stencils in those two families
    # places them by the same two rules, which are the roles' own meanings and
    # not a layout convention:
    #
    #   relief -- on the CROWN, beside the vent. CHEE4001 p.7 puts the PSV,
    #       wherever it can be, on the protected system itself, upright,
    #       discharging upward, at the top of the container.
    #       Measured onto the head's own arc or slope rather than onto the box's
    #       top edge, for the reason the roofs below are: a head rises inside
    #       its bounding box, so a nozzle on the edge floats above the ink.
    #   drain -- on the vessel's LOWEST DRAWN POINT, because that is what a
    #       drain is. Where the stencil draws a support -- legs, a skirt, the
    #       sphere's frame -- the low point is INBOARD of the box's bottom, and
    #       the nozzle goes on the vessel rather than on the steel: a drain out
    #       of the bottom of a leg is worse than a drain that leaves sideways.
    #
    # That second case has a consequence worth stating rather than discovering.
    # ``portgeom.outward_dir`` reads a nozzle's face off the nearest box edge,
    # so on ``vessel/legs`` and ``vessel/skirted``, whose 40 x 122.69 box is a
    # third leg by height, the bottom head's centre is nearer a side wall (20)
    # than the box's floor (27.3) and the drain comes out WEST at the symbol's
    # own aspect. Give the unit a box less than about 2.2 times as tall as it is
    # wide -- 60 x 120, which is what ``examples/14`` draws V-604 at -- and it
    # comes out south. Supports pushing a nozzle's face around is #225's
    # territory, and papering over it here with a second placement rule would
    # put the drain somewhere that is not the low point in order to get a face.

    # Feed enters on the left; the returns come back on the RIGHT, which is the
    # side the overhead and reboiler systems are drawn on. reflux_in sits high
    # and boilup_in low on the straight shell wall (which spans y 15..185), with
    # the two duty arrows spaced between them.
    #
    # The feeds are a family: an extractive tower takes its solvent above the
    # feed tray. They stay on the west wall, and every member of it, at every
    # count, lands strictly between the two duty arrows' heights. Those two are
    # the INNERMOST fixed nozzles on the wall opposite (65 and 145, against
    # reflux_in's 35 and boilup_in's 175), so a band bounded by them is bounded
    # by all four: no feed is drawn at the elevation of a return or of a duty
    # arrow, however many feeds there are.
    #
    # The arithmetic. The band is 65..145, which is 80 units of the 200-unit
    # shell centred on 105, so ``at`` is 105. (It was 130, the height the
    # single-feed nozzle was drawn at before the family existed, and a family
    # centred 25 below its own band runs off the bottom of it at the second
    # feed.) The band's *width* is the widest whole number of pitches that fits
    # inside it: 2 x 35 = 70, since 3 x 35 = 105 is more than the 80 there is.
    # So extent = 70 / 200 = 0.35, and the outermost members land on
    # 105 -+ 35 = 70 and 140. The (80 - 70) / 2 = 5 units left under each arrow
    # are the point of not spending the whole band rather than a margin picked
    # by eye: at extent 0.4 the outermost feeds land exactly ON 65 and 145,
    # level with a duty arrow on the wall opposite, so the two leave the vessel
    # at one elevation and read as one line drawn across it.

    # For a reader: one, two or three feeds sit at the declared 35 pitch, and
    # the fourth is where PortSeries begins squeezing the run into ``extent``
    # rather than running it off the ends.
    # ``draw`` is the feed family read the other way: the same band, the
    # same arithmetic, the opposite wall. A draw leaves over the east
    # face a feed enters the west one on, so it shares the feed family's
    # ``at``/``pitch``/``extent`` outright rather than deriving its own --
    # centred on 105 with a 70-unit band, it lands strictly inside the
    # 65..145 the duty arrows already bound on *this* wall, the same
    # clearance the feeds get on theirs. ``n_draws`` defaults to zero, so
    # nothing here is drawn on a sheet that does not ask for one.

    # jacket wrapped round its lower half -- and then a motor box, a shaft and a
    # pair of impeller ellipses drawn INTO the artwork. pandid draws those from
    # ISO group 28 and item 20.6, composed by ``Reactor(agitator=...)``, so
    # vendoring this puts a second drawing of one piece of equipment in the
    # library with nothing to say which is the live one, and it is the worse of
    # the two: its impeller is ink and cannot be changed to the one the plant
    # has. That is the fault issue #307 is about. (``mixing`` is kept beside it
    # for the opposite reason: its BODY is a different vessel, a rectangle with
    # a V bottom, so it says something the composition cannot.)
    #
    # The second is that same drawing again with the jacket replaced by six
    # limpet-coil turns in section, three down each shell wall. Those turns are
    # the whole of what tells the two apart, and a coil is piped supply and
    # return -- two nozzles, where ``Reactor`` declares one ``duty`` and
    # ``Vessel`` declares none at all. So the marks that would make it worth
    # having are the marks that cannot be connected to. It is the same gap
    # ``examples/17_stirred_reactor_train.py`` already records against the
    # jacket, and closing it is a change to the classes rather than a line here.
    # A half-pipe jacket and a conventional one are in any case a datasheet
    # fact: on a P&ID they are one vessel with a heating medium on it.
    # The flash drum: the same plain dished-head cylinder the vessel and the
    # column are drawn from, with the phases named. ``vessel``/``horizontal``
    # and ``separator``/``horizontal`` are already one stencil ("Drum or
    # Condenser") differing only in what its nozzles are called, because a
    # separator IS a vessel the author wants the vapour and liquid products
    # named on; the vertical pair was the odd one out, and this makes the
    # family consistent in both attitudes.
    #
    # It is also what the class actually claims. A Separator is documented as
    # the generic flash drum or phase separator, and "Knock-out Drum" asserts
    # two internals the model never said were there:
    #
    # * a LEVEL GAUGE, drawn as a rect and two verticals hanging off the right
    #   shell wall at x 40..51. pandid draws instruments as ISA-5.1 balloons on
    #   signal lines (``pandid/loops.py``), so a gauge baked into the equipment
    #   artwork is drawn a second time the moment a real LG or LT is added.
    # * a DEMISTER PAD, the crosshatch at y 17.69..27.69. A mesh pad is a design
    #   decision about entrainment, not something every flash drum has.
    #
    # Neither is lost: ``knockout`` below is that stencil, kept under a name
    # that says what it draws, for the author who does want the mesh pad.
    #
    # Ports are the vessel's, in the vessel's places, since switching a vessel
    # for a separator is a change of what the nozzles are called and not of
    # where they are: feed in the west shell wall at mid-height (the straight
    # shell spans y 15..185, so it is on ink at any box the unit is drawn at,
    # rather than on a head where the ink curves away from the box edge), and
    # the two products on the head crowns at (50, 0) and (50, 200), which is
    # exactly where the column takes its distillate and its bottoms.
    #
    # The feed is a FAMILY -- a flash drum charged twice is a wash stream, or a
    # second phase to knock out -- and it is CENTRED on the 100 the single feed
    # has always been drawn at, so a one-feed drum is drawn exactly as 0.1.3
    # drew it. Centred rather than run downwards, unlike the hopper bodies
    # below: this nozzle is at mid-height with 85 units of straight shell above
    # it and 85 below, which is the case that mode is for.
    #
    # The band is 0,5 of the shell -- y 50..150 unscaled, 25..75 as drawn --
    # which is inside the straight wall (15..185, or 7,5..92,5) at both ends.
    # The pitch is 40, or 20 as drawn.
    #
    # Measured against the ARROWHEAD rather than borrowed from the stirred
    # tank this shell is shared with. The reactor's own band is 28/0,32, which
    # spaces TWO charge nozzles 14 apart as drawn -- under
    # ``symbols.MIN_NOZZLE_PITCH``, so the commonest multi-feed count there is
    # a ``nozzles-crowded`` finding before it is anything else. Copying that
    # here would have shipped the same defect on a new keyword. At 40/0,5 a
    # drum draws two feeds 20 apart, three 20 apart and four 16,7 apart, all of
    # them clear of two 12-unit heads; five is where the squeeze takes it under
    # and where the finding is right to fire.

    # THE STEAM TRAP IS NOT HERE, and the reason is worth writing down, because
    # every steam system has one and this table has thirty-eight fittings

    #
    # piping.xml's "Steam Trap" draws nothing. It is a bare 50 x 50 rect with a
    # W and an E constraint and an empty foreground -- and it is byte-for-byte

    # "Ball Valve" (strip the two names and the XML is identical; the only other
    # such group in the file is Detonation Arrestor / Flame Arrestor / In-Line
    # Silencer). At this file's 0.5 it comes out a 25 x 25 empty square, which
    # is what ``SymbolRegistry._generic_symbol`` already draws for a kind with
    # no artwork at all. So vendoring it registers a blank box under two device
    # names, which is the Globe Valve fault and issue #307's, committed on
    # purpose.
    #
    # STENCIL_PATCHES cannot answer this one. That mechanism corrects a shape
    # the stencil draws WRONGLY, and the globe valve's patch works because it
    # quotes the stencil's own arcs back at it -- the seat was already drawn and
    # only the fill was missing. Here there is nothing to quote: a trap's mark
    # would be new artwork, which is a hand-drawn primitive under CONTRIBUTING
    # section 1 and not a vendoring, and which STENCIL_PATCHES says outright it
    # is not for.
    #
    # The gap is real and is being worked round today:
    # ``examples/15_condensing_turbine.py`` draws its trap as a
    # ``Product("Steam Trap Drain")``, which is a sheet boundary rather than a
    # device in the run.
    # Spectacle blind (figure-8 blind): two discs on a common tie, one bored
    # through and one solid, bolted between a pair of flanges. Which of them is
    # in the line is the whole of what it says, so it is the one in-line device
    # the stencil set draws in two states -- see CLOSED_SHAPES, and
    # ``Fitting(normal_position=...)``, which is how a user asks for the other.
    #
    # The stencil is 20 x 80: the two discs stacked at y 0..40, then a 40-long
    # tie down to a lone "S" constraint at (10, 80). That constraint is where
    # draw.io means the drawing to be dropped on a line, which would make this a
    # flag on a stalk rather than a device in a run -- and a Fitting is a pair of
    # faces on a line. So the run is taken THROUGH the disc in function, which
    # is the lower one: the stencil pair fills that disc in the closed state and
    # the upper, parked one in the open state, so a line drawn through it meets
    # solid ink exactly when the line is blanked. Both points are on the
    # ellipse's own extrema (it spans y 20..40 about x = 10, r = 10), and the
    # tie hangs below the run as the handle it is.
    #
    # Piping the two ends N and S instead -- along the stencil's own axis, with
    # the tie read as pipe -- draws every blind across its run, since face

    # THIS IS THE ONE STENCIL IN THE LIBRARY THAT DRAWS A PROCESS NOZZLE AS A
    # NOZZLE (all 229 registered symbols were swept for a second; the only

    # excluded as not a process nozzle -- see ``_NOT_NOZZLES`` and
    # ``tests/test_symbol_invariants.py``'s drawn-nozzle check). Three 12 x 12
    # rectangles, each with a flange line ruled across its free face: two on the
    # crown at x 18..30 and 50..62, faces at y = 0, and one under the belly at
    # x 34..46, face at y = 90. A rectangle drawn on a vessel is a statement
    # that a connection exists *there*, so a port anywhere else on this drawing
    # is the drawing disagreeing with itself. That is issue #225, and the whole
    # of what it costs is that three nozzles have to carry five duties.
    #
    # WHICH THREE DUTIES GET THE NOZZLES. Two of the five are fixed by
    # something other than preference and both are on top. CHEE4001 p.7 puts the
    # protective device there -- wherever it can be, the PSV goes on the
    # protected system itself, upright, discharging upward, at the top of the
    # container -- so ``relief`` takes a crown rectangle. ``vent`` is
    # the vapour connection and a vapour space is at the top of a vessel by
    # definition, so it takes the other. Which rectangle is which is arbitrary;
    # they are one drawing twice. That leaves the belly nozzle for one of the
    # three liquid duties, and ``outlet`` has it: the draw is what the vessel is
    # piped for on every day of its life, and on this sheet it is the whole
    # reason the sphere is drawn at all (``examples/14``'s butane leaves under
    # its own pressure and needs no pump). It also had the more visible half of
    # the defect -- the outlet sat at (40, 100), on the base rail of the support
    # skirt, so the sheet drew product leaving the *structure* 10 units below
    # the nozzle the stencil drew for it.
    #
    # WHERE THE OTHER TWO GO. ``inlet`` and ``drain`` are both liquid and both
    # therefore belong low, which is also the research issue #226 recorded for
    # this vessel: an LPG sphere takes liquid in and out at the lowest part of
    # the shell and reserves the crown for relief and vapour. They go on the
    # shell either side of the belly nozzle, which is the ordinary convention
    # and what every other stencil in the library does with every nozzle it has
    # -- 226 of the other 227 draw no nozzle at all and let the line stop at
    # the wall; the exception, ``separator/knockout``, draws a gauge stub
    # rather than a process nozzle (see above).
    # They are NOT stacked on the belly rectangle with the outlet: two ports on
    # one placement draw two streams on one point, which
    # ``Symbol.coincident_ports`` refuses and is right to.
    #
    # All three sit on the ellipse (cx 40, cy 45, r 40), so each coordinate is
    # the circle solved for the height wanted:
    #
    #   inlet, the fill, at y = 75:   x = 40 -+ 40*sqrt(1 - (30/40)^2) = 13.5 / 66.5
    #   drain, the water draw-off, at y = 82.1: x = 40 + 40*sqrt(1 - (37.1/40)^2) = 54.9
    #
    # The fill is the one port here with a face to choose, so it is the one with
    # a menu: west by default and east on request, since a sphere is filled from
    # whichever side the header runs down. 75 rather than 82.1 is what buys it
    # those faces -- at 82.1 the point is nearer the box floor than either wall
    # and ``outward_dir`` reads it as south, and a fill drawn arriving from
    # underneath is a line the reader has to follow around the vessel to
    # believe. The drain keeps south, which is the face its role asks for
    # (``tests/test_symbol_invariants.py``) and where a low-point draw-off goes.
    #
    # The crown is deliberately left with no fill placement on it. A pressure
    # sphere's two top connections are spoken for, and offering ``inlet`` an

    # place on the drawing. ``conical`` already means the roof alone, so the
    # three names line up: one cone on top, one underneath, or one at each end.
    #
    # 101 x 150, and the tallest thing in the family by half again. That is the
    # shape and not the scale: it is 101 wide, which is the 100 every other tank
    # here is drawn at, and the extra height is the two 30-unit cones over and
    # under a shell that is itself only 20 taller than ``conical``'s. Squashing
    # it to the family's height would draw shallower cones than the stencil
    # author drew, and the cone angle is what the variant is about.
    #
    # Both nozzles sit at x = 51 rather than 50 because the drawing does: the
    # stencil puts its shell walls at x = 1 and x = 101 in a box 101 wide, so
    # the two apexes are on the SHELL's centreline, half a unit right of the
    # box's, and a nozzle at 50 would be half a unit off the point of the cone.
    #
    # Both cones are half as steep as they are wide -- 30 of rise over 50 of
    # run -- so the midpoint of each slope is 25 across and 15 down from its
    # apex: (26, 15) and (76, 15) on the roof, (26, 135) on the floor. All three
    # keep the shell's x = 1..101, so the pair on the roof are as far either
    # side of the fill as ``default``'s are, scaled to a taller drawing.
    # The alternate fills take the shell walls at y = 110, ten above the cone.
    # The west one is named outright: the wall is at x = 1 rather than at the
    # box edge, for the same half-unit reason the two apexes are at x = 51.

    # THE GAS CONNECTIONS ARE ON THE SEAL TANK, not on the bell, and that is

    # to the bell is a pipe joined to something that travels the height of the
    # holder every time it fills. The main enters the tank wall and turns up
    # inside, so ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` take the two walls -- which the outline

    # THE OPEN-TOPPED CONTAINERS ARE ALL OUT, and one rule turns all four away:
    # ``Tank`` carries a vent, a relief and a fill, every variant has to anchor
    # all five of its nozzles on drawn ink (``tests/test_symbol_invariants.py``
    # holds both halves), and ``vent`` and ``relief`` are positioned by their
    # roles on the top of the container. An open container has no top to put
    # them on.
    #
    # "Bunker (Conical Bottom)" is the clearest case, because it is a shape the
    # library already draws with a lid: it is "Tank (Conical Bottom)" -- the
    # same 100 x 100 outline, the same cone from y = 70 to an apex at (50, 100)
    # -- with the roof line and the cone's springing line left off. So its box's
    # top edge carries ink at exactly two points, the tops of the two shell
    # walls, and the three roof connections ``tank/conical_bottom`` places at
    # (35, 0), (50, 0) and (65, 0) have nothing under them. "Container, Tank,
    # Cistern", ISO's own open tank 2061, is the same three-sided outline
    # without the cone; "Tank (Covered)" and "Open Bulk Storage" are the lidded
    # trough and the hatched stockpile beside it.
    #
    # The change that lets them in is a nozzle set for a container that is open
    # -- a rim rather than a crown -- and that is a change to ``units.Tank``,
    # not a line added to a port map.
    #
    # Two more shapes in vessels.xml were weighed with those and left out, and
    # both for the same reason: a nozzle a class has no name for is a nozzle
    # that cannot be drawn.
    #
    #   "Tank (Boot)", and the covered and floating-roof tanks drawn with one --
    #   the sump welded under one end that a settled water phase is drawn off
    #   separately from the product. The boot IS the variant: a tank with one
    #   drawn and piped like a tank without one says nothing the plain tank does
    #   not, and Tank.PORTS was inlet/outlet, so there was no third draw to put
    #   on it. That half of the objection is now spent -- issue #222 gave Tank
    #   the ``drain`` a settled phase leaves by, which is exactly the boot's
    #   draw -- and the shapes are still out, because the change that lets them
    #   in is a vendoring with its own measurements and its own place in the
    #   variants table, not a line added to a port map.
    #
    #   "Vessel (Full-Tube Heating-Cooling Coil)" and its semi-tube sibling --
    #   a 120 x 70 box holding a bare 100 x 70 rect, with the coil's four cut
    #   tube ends drawn as circles beside it at (5, 25), (5, 55), (115, 15) and
    #   (115, 45). Those four are
    #   the only nozzles the shape draws and all four are the coil's, which
    #   Vessel has no port for; inlet and outlet would land on plain casing
    #   wall, which is what ``pump/peristaltic`` refuses on this same principle
    #   (a drawn nozzle wins). There is nothing else to weigh against it either:
    #   no head, no crown and no drawn level, so the vessel family's own reason
    #   for not turning would have to be invented for it as well.
    # Thickener / clarifier: draw.io's "Settling Tank", 100 x 80, and the one
    # shape in the whole set that is a thickener's own silhouette rather than
    # something else pressed into the job. Walls from y 0 down to y 55, then a
    # shallow floor falling to an apex at (50, 80) -- a wide, shallow tank with
    # a raked cone under it, which is what a thickener is and what neither a
    # separating vessel nor a conical-bottomed tank looks like.
    #
    # OPEN AT THE TOP, and that is why the three nozzles sit where they do. The
    # box's top edge carries ink at exactly two points, the tops of the two
    # walls, so nothing may be anchored across it: ``feed`` and ``overflow``
    # take the two walls at y = 8, which is a launder entering one side and the
    # clarified liquor leaving over a weir on the other, and ``underflow``
    # takes the apex the rake ploughs the thickened solids into.
    #
    # No SCALE entry. vessels.xml is on the ~100-unit module every tank and

#   thing that keeps fittings.xml's "Orifice Plate" out of the table above.
#

#   filled, at 40 x 140 instead of 20 x 80 (1:3.5 against 1:4). Two mappings a

# Symbols that must not be turned, as ``Symbol.gravity_fixed``.
#
# ISO 15519-1 §11.4.2, *Orientation of graphical symbols*, permits turning and
# mirroring so that a symbol fits the layout the diagram actually has, and then
# excepts one class of symbol: anything for a component or device whose function
# depends on gravity. It names two of them, the open tank (2061) and the cyclone
# separator (X 2618), drawn at Figure 22 b), and those must not be turned.
#
# Figure 22 b) draws those two: an open-topped U, and a body whose conical apex
# points down with the vortex spiralling into it. Both are devices whose *job* is
# done by gravity, and both say something the plant cannot do once turned.
#
# The test applied here is that one, not "stands on the ground": every piece of
# plant does. A symbol is listed when the separation, containment or holdup it
# depicts is performed by gravity **and the artwork draws it**: a free liquid
# surface, an open top, a settling or classifying body with a low-point draw, a
# falling-solids path. A device whose function is pressure, rotation, heat
# transfer or throttling is not listed even when a nozzle happens to sit low,
# because it is installed in whatever attitude the run wants and turning its
# symbol states nothing false.
#
# What that leaves out, and why:
#
# * ``hex/kettle`` -- its bottoms draw is at the weir end and low, but an
#   exchanger's function is heat transfer and the artwork draws no level. The
#   rest of the shell-and-tube family is freely turnable and this one shares it.
# * ``valve/bleed`` -- inlet N / outlet S encodes a *piping arrangement* (the
#   stencil draws the tap running down into the bowtie), and varying a piping
#   arrangement is what ``pin()`` and ``nozzle()`` are for. A bleeder tapped off
#   the top of a line is the same device.
# * ``conveyor`` -- its artwork is two rollers and a bar, symmetric top to
#   bottom, so a turn makes nothing in the drawing false; the gravity fact about
#   a belt lives in its port alternates (feed from above, discharge from
#   underneath), which the symbol already fixes. ISO cites the conveyor in
#   §13.1 as the case for a *horizontal-view* layout, which is about the sheet
#   rather than about the symbol.
# * ``dryer/default`` -- a rotary drum drawn as a circle in a box; nothing in it
#   is up or down. Contrast ``dryer/spray`` and ``dryer/fluidized_bed`` below.
# * ``fitting/*`` and every LIQUID ``filter`` -- plate packs, cartridges, resin
#   and media beds, and a cloth on its rollers, all drawn as bands in a box and
#   all driven by pressure drop across the medium. A bed rests on its support
#   the way every piece of plant rests on the ground; nothing in the artwork is
#   a level, a hopper or a fall. The gas ones are listed below, and they are
#   listed for the hopper drawn under the medium rather than for the medium.
#

# Where a *family* may put a nozzle on a face, as ``{face: (lo, hi)}`` measured
# along that face in the symbol's own finished coordinates -- top to bottom on
# W/E, left to right on N/S. Emitted as ``Symbol.bands``; see it, and
# :func:`pandid.render.symbols.spread`, which treats the pair as a hard limit
# and slides a run into it rather than drawing past it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A tank's or a vessel's inlets and outlets are a family whose
# count is the unit's, so ``vessel_symbol`` spreads them from the one nozzle the
# stencil drew. That nozzle is a *point*, and it says nothing about how much
# wall there is either side of it -- so a family centred on it walked off the
# body: three inlets on tank/default put the third 9,5 units below the bottom of
# the drawing, and the stream to it ended in blank paper (#488). The wall is a
# feature of the artwork with no dimension anywhere until here.
#
# HOW EACH PAIR IS ARRIVED AT. The band is the straight run of shell that face
# offers, held off each end by a clearance so a nozzle is never drawn into the
# weld where a head, a roof or a floor is attached. Two readings of that
# clearance, and each entry's comment says which it took:
#
#   * where the stencil drew its nozzle hard against one end of the wall -- a
#     tank fills low on the shell, ten above the floor, see ("tank", "default")
#     in KIND_MAP -- the clearance is that nozzle's own, taken at both ends. The
#     drawn nozzle is then exactly the band's end, so a lone connection does not
#     move and a family stacks away from it up the same wall.
#   * where the nozzle is at mid-height -- a drum is fed at the middle of its
#     shell -- there is no such statement to read, and the clearance is 10, the
#     one the tank stencils' own low nozzles keep.
#
# A DOME CROWN IS A BAND OF NO LENGTH, NOT A MISSING BAND. A dished roof, a cone
# apex and a dished head touch their face at exactly one point: a nozzle there
# is on the ink and a *second* one beside it, at the same inset, is in mid-air
# over the roof. That is the reported defect again on a curved face -- three
# ``inputs=["N"]`` on tank/default put the outer two 2,65 units clear of the
# dome, inside the box and off the drawing -- so those faces declare the point
# they offer, ``(t, t)``, rather than being left out. A family of more than one
# member on a band of no length is refused outright by
# :func:`pandid.render.symbols.crowded_band`: there is nowhere on that face to
# draw the second nozzle, the shell is where a second connection goes, and
# saying so beats drawing it in the air.
#
# So every face either family may be piped from is named here, for every body.
# ``test_every_family_face_declares_a_band`` holds that: a face with a
# placement and no band would be a family bounded by the box alone.

# draw.io draws inline devices oversized; scale them to read as small devices

#
# A key is a kind, or one (kind, variant) where a single variant is drawn at a
# different size from the rest of its class. A value is one factor, or a pair
# (sx, sy) for the cases where a symbol has to be *reproportioned* rather than
# merely resized: the vessel, the flash drum and the column are all cut from one
# stencil, and the first two are the short ones.
#
# An uneven pair is the one case where that compensation cannot be exact, since
# it strokes the artwork with an elliptical pen (see ``drawing``). It divides by
# sqrt(sx*sy), so nothing under such a pair lands ON 2px: a vertical stroke
# comes out sqrt(sx/sy) heavy and a horizontal one the same factor light, about
# a pen whose area is the sheet's. It used to divide by sx alone, which put the
# vertical strokes exactly on 2px and left the horizontal ones at sy/sx of it --
# a fifth light on the vessel and the flash drum, and under half on the packed
# tower, where the bed grids read as a different sheet's ink from the shell they
# sit in. Nothing here chooses which axis is the true one any more, because
# there is no reading of a drawing on which one of them is.
#
# 0.25 is the inline family's factor, and it is measured rather than chosen. A
# drawing unit is the CSS pixel, so an A3 sheet is 420 mm x 96/25.4 = 1587 units
# wide and 1 mm is 3.78 of them. An issued A3 P&ID draws its gate valves 17.0 pt
# long and 8.5 pt across (6.0 mm x 3.0 mm), the same 17.0 pt its instrument
# balloons and its interlock squares are drawn at, the whole sheet being cut to
# one 6 mm module. The valve stencil is 98 x 60, so 0.25 puts it at 24.5 x 15.0
# units, 6.5 mm x 4.0 mm: within 8% of the reference along the flow axis, which
# is the axis that decides how many valves fit on a run. At the 0.5 this
# replaces, the same valve was 49 units (13 mm, over twice the reference), which
# is why a station with isolation valves either side of a control valve took the
# width five valves and a flow element occupy on a real sheet.
#
# It stays a single factor rather than an (sx, sy) pair even though the
# reference's bowtie is 2:1 against the stencil's 98:60. Squashing the family to
# match would draw the globe and ball seats as ovals and the check valve's
# arrowhead askew, and an uneven pair strokes with an elliptical pen no single
# stroke-width can round out, so the diagonals would land off 2px whatever the
# compensation divides by. A valve one third taller than the reference's is a
# smaller error than a valve whose internals are wrong.
#
# Everything that shares a pipe with a valve takes the same factor, because they
# share a line size: a strainer, an orifice plate or a sight glass left at the
# old scale would be drawn half again longer than the valve beside it.
# ``reducer`` is the exception in this family and has its own entry below: it is
# a piping.xml shape drawn on a 20-unit module, so 0.25 would put it at 5 units
# long, a fifth of the valve it sits beside.
#
# flow_sensors.xml and piping.xml are the exception, and for a reason that is
# about the stencils rather than about the drawing: they lay their in-line
# devices out on a 50-unit module where valves.xml and fittings.xml use a ~100
# one. Halving those would draw a venturi 12.5 units long beside a 24.5-unit
# valve, so they take 0.5 and land on the same 25 x ~20 box the flame arrestors
# and the static mixer already occupy. Same sheet size, different stencil scale.

    # flow_sensors.xml: the primary elements

    # ...and the spectacle blind, which is on that file's module like the rest
    # of them and takes its factor for the same reason. It happens to be the
    # right size for its own reason too: 0.5 draws each disc 10 units across, so
    # the figure-8 is 20, the 5.3 mm that lands on the reference sheet's 6 mm
    # module, and enough for the open disc's 8-unit bore to read as a hole
    # rather than as a thick dot. The whole symbol is that one distinction, so
    # it was checked at 1:1 and at print before this factor was settled; 0.375
    # closes the bore to 5.5 units and the two states start to converge.

)

# Three shapes in valves.xml are not on that file's ~98-unit module, so the
# kind's 0.25 draws them undersized: Safety PSV 1 is 55.5 x 94.5, Relief PRV
# 40 x 59 and Pneumatic Operated Butterfly Valve 60 x 80, coming out at 13.9,
# 10.0 and 15.0 units of length against everyone else's 24.5. Each therefore
# takes its own factor below.
#
# What "the same size as the rest of the family" means is NOT the box, because
# these are upright devices and the box holds whatever rides above the body: a
# spring bonnet, a diaphragm dome, an operator. Forcing them into a gate valve's
# landscape 24.5 x 15.0 would shrink the part that carries the flow to make room
# for the part that does not.
#
# It is the SEAT. Every valve body in valves.xml is the same pair of triangles,
# 60 units across the run with a 49-unit apex, and 0.25 draws that pair 15.0
# across and 12.25 along wherever it appears. Gate Valve sets them base to base
# and comes out 24.5 x 15.0; Angle folds them into an L (its own path is
# (0,79)-(30,30)-(79,0)-(79,60)-(30,30)-(60,79), which is that triangle twice)
# and comes out 19.8 x 19.8 at the very same 0.25. So an upright valve is sized
# by drawing ITS seat at 15.0 across the run, and the bonnet above it is extra
# height rather than a reason to shrink the seat.
#
# Safety PSV 1 draws exactly that pair, at 0.7 of the size: the inlet leg is
# (0,94.5)-(21,60)-(42,94.5), a 42-wide base under a 34.5 apex, and the outlet
# leg is the same triangle turned a quarter. 15.0 / 42 restores it, putting the
# base on the family's 15.0 and the apex on 12.3 against the family's 12.25. It
# comes out 19.8 x 33.8, whose lower 19.8 x 19.8 is valve/angle's box to the
# decimal -- the same quarter-turn body, with 14 units of spring bonnet on top.
# One factor and not a pair: the three spring strokes and both seat faces are
# diagonals, which a non-uniform factor would tilt, and would stroke with a pen
# no compensation can hold round, so they would also land off 2px. That is the
# reason the valve family takes a single factor at all (see the paragraph
# above).
#
# Relief PRV has no seat to measure: it is a 40-wide semicircular bonnet on a
# stem, piped S to N, so across-the-run is that bonnet and 15.0 / 40 is the same
# statement. It comes out 15.0 x 22.1 -- a gate valve's 15.0 across the run,
# and 22.1 along it where a gate valve is 24.5, the difference being that this
# one spends its length on a stem rather than on a bowtie. Uniform again,
# because the bonnet is a true semicircle and a pair would draw it as a half
# ellipse. The check that a bonnet is a bonnet across the three: this shape and
# the butterfly draw the identical 40 x 20 semicircle, and come out 15.0 x 7.5
# and 16.3 x 7.5.
#
# Pneumatic Operated Butterfly Valve is the one that does need the pair. Its
# body is a plain rect, x 0..60 and y 40..80, at 3:2 where the family's bowtie
# is 98:60, so a single factor cannot put the body on 24.5 x 15.0 and the run on
# the family's height at once. (24.5/60, 15.0/40) does both: a 24.5 x 15.0 body
# in a 24.5 x 30.0 box, with the W/E anchors at y = 0.75 landing 7.5 above the
# bottom, which is where every other straight-through valve carries the line.
# Uniform at 24.5/60 would leave the run 8.2 up and still off the family's run.

    ``mxgraph.pid.valves.gate_valve``, which is what a ``shape=`` in a draw.io
