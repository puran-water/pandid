"""Generate docs/gallery/: every example rendered to SVG and rasterised to PNG.

The gallery is the first thing a reader sees and the last generated artefact
that had nothing holding it to its source. It drifted: `04_control_loop.svg` sat
on `main` for a dozen rendering PRs showing a drawing the package had stopped
producing. This script is the one command that rebuilds it, and
`tests/test_gallery.py` is what fails when the committed copy stops being the
drawing its golden holds -- the same pairing `scripts/vendor_symbols.py` and
`scripts/gen_devices.py` already have with their own generated files, with the
render behind it left to `tests/test_golden.py` rather than run a third time
(#302).

Run:  python scripts/gallery.py

Three things it does that copying the examples' own output by hand did not.

**It renders against this checkout.** ``examples/_bootstrap.py`` prepends the
repo root only when ``find_spec("pandid") is None``, so on a machine with a
released ``pandid`` installed -- which is most machines, and every one that has
run ``pip install pandid`` once -- running an example plainly renders against
*that* and not against the working tree. A gallery built that way shows the last
release, and a check built that way passes against the wrong code. This puts the
checkout first on ``sys.path`` and then refuses to run unless that is where
``pandid`` came from.

**It never has to rename anything.** Each example writes a name of its own into
``examples/`` (``01_ammonia_loop.py`` writes ``ammonia_auto.svg``), so copying
the output in was a rename, done by hand, once per example. Instead of running
the scripts and copying files, this imports each one with ``Flowsheet.render``
stubbed, catching the flowsheet and the keyword arguments it was about to be
drawn with, and renders it here under the example's own stem. Nothing is written
into ``examples/`` and there is no mapping to get wrong.

**It stamps a date that does not churn.** ``03`` and ``08`` leave
``TitleBlock.date`` blank, which the renderer fills in with today's, so
regenerating them moved the date and nothing else -- a daily diff on a
committed artefact and a freshness check that could never compare exactly.
:func:`_stamp` fills that field, before the render, with the newest revision's
date: the date the sheet was in fact issued at, taken from the sheet's own
revision history rather than from a constant kept in step by hand.
``tests/test_golden.py`` pins the same field, to the same value, so the golden
and the gallery sheet made from one example are the same drawing rather than two
that differ in one cell;
``test_no_fixture_dates_a_sheet_differently_from_the_generator`` holds them to
it. Only a *blank* field is filled: a date the author stated is theirs, and
replacing it would ship a drawing dated a day nobody typed
(``test_the_generator_leaves_a_date_the_sheet_states_alone``).

#
# Crop one revision row's description cell -- glyphs only, no rule -- and read
# the darkest pixel in it. Across the five sheets that carried a title block
# when the width was chosen (13 and 14 have since added two more, and are the
# same 7,5-unit lettering at the same widths):

#     3000       9     0     0     1     1
#
# At 1600 the darkest ink in that lettering is mid-grey; the strings are legible
# as shapes and not as letters. 2400 puts every sheet at or near black, and the
# inked fraction of the cell stops climbing there -- at 3000 it is flat or a
# shade lower, which is more anti-aliasing rather than more letter. Sixteen
# PNGs weigh 1.56 MiB at 1600, 2.56 at 2400 and 3.35 at 3000, so the 1.00 MiB
# from 1600 to 2400 buys a readable title block and the next 0.79 buys very
# little. (The darkest-pixel table above is per sheet and does not move with the
# size of the corpus; the weights do, and are re-measured with it.)
#
# Supersampling and downsampling does not substitute: rendering at 2x and
# resampling averages a one-pixel stroke back into its background, which is the
# same grey by another route. Device pixels are what a 7.5-unit glyph needs.
