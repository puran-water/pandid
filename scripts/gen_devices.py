"""Generate pandid/devices.py: one class per piece of equipment the registry draws.

The library models equipment as a ``kind`` and a ``variant``, which is what the
symbol registry is keyed by and what a sheet is drawn from. That is the right
model for *drawing* and the wrong one for *finding*: an engineer looking for a
cyclone searches for ``Cyclone``, not for ``Separator(variant="cyclone")``, and
a type checker asked about ``sep.underflow`` on the second form can only shrug,
because the nozzle depends on a string. This file is the mapping from the one to
the other, and ``pandid/devices.py`` is what it emits.

The rule, in one line: **a class is what the equipment is; ``variant=`` is how it
is drawn.** Precisely -- a variant becomes a class when it names a distinct
*scheduled item*, something with a row of its own on an equipment list. It stays
a variant when it names a support, a roof, a cladding, an attitude, a drawn
internal, a certification rating or a body style within one bought item. Outside
``pandid.document._MAJOR_EQUIPMENT``, which is already this library's own
definition of "bought as an item", a variant becomes a class only where the
**ports** or a **declarable property** differ. That line is what keeps this at
seventy-odd classes instead of one apiece for every registered variant.

**A narrower or wider port set earns a class with no drawing behind it at
all.** Every class this file generates is named for a *drawing*: a
registered ``(kind, variant)`` this module claims and hands a ``PORTS``
list read off the registry. ``pandid.units.DistillationColumn``,
``pandid.units.Absorber`` and ``pandid.units.Stripper`` are not that. All
three draw exactly what ``Column`` already draws -- ISO gives none of
them a symbol, so there is no new stencil, no new registry key, and
nothing for :func:`claims` to see -- and what tells them apart is only
which of the general tower's return nozzles each one has: a distillation
column has all four (a reboiler, a condenser and the reflux that closes
the loop between them), a stripper a reboiler and no condenser, an
absorber neither. So none is in ``DEVICES``, ``OWNS`` or
``STAYS_ON_BASE``, and this script does not generate any of them; they are
written by hand in ``pandid/units.py`` next to ``Column`` itself, the one
other class in this codebase whose ports this file does not own. A future
class earns the same treatment on the same test: no drawing of its own,
and a port set narrower or wider than its base's that stating the base's
own set on it would be false.

Three tables say the rest of it, and :func:`claims` holds them to the registry:

``DEVICES``       the (kind, variant) a class is *named for*, its class name and
                  its docstring. One entry per class.
``OWNS``          the other drawings a class also answers for, as
                  ``{class-local variant: registry variant}``. A class not named
                  here owns its ``DEVICES`` drawing and nothing else.
``STAYS_ON_BASE`` every drawing that gets no class, each with the word from the
                  rule that says why.

**The anti-drift check is the point.** :func:`claims` imports the live registry
and refuses to generate unless every registered ``(kind, variant)`` is claimed
exactly once, by one of those three. Vendor a new stencil and this script stops
until someone has said what the equipment *is*, which is the one question a
symbol table cannot answer for itself. It mirrors the ``SystemExit`` orphan
checks in ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py``, in the same voice and for the same
reason.

It claims every registry **key**, not every distinct drawing. ``valve/default``
and ``valve/gate`` are one shape under two keys, as are ``hex/default`` and
``hex/shell_tube``, ``fitting/default`` and ``fitting/flange``, and
``reducer/default`` and ``reducer/concentric``; ``instrument/sis`` and
``instrument/logic`` are the *same Symbol object* registered twice. Each key is
claimed on its own, because each is a name a caller may write.

HEADER = '''"""Equipment classes: what a piece of plant *is*, over its drawing.

GENERATED by scripts/gen_devices.py. Do not edit by hand.

:mod:`pandid.units` models equipment as a ``kind`` and a ``variant``,
which is what the symbol registry is keyed by and what a sheet is drawn
from. This module is the other half: one class per device the registry
draws, so that

    * an engineer looking for a cyclone finds :class:`Cyclone` rather
      than having to know it is ``Separator(variant="cyclone")``;
    * a type checker can answer ``cyclone.underflow``, because the
      nozzles are declared on the class and not held in a string;
    * an equipment list reads as equipment.

The split follows **a class is what the equipment is and ``variant=``
is how it is drawn**: a variant becomes a class when it names a distinct
scheduled item, and stays a variant when it names a support, a roof, a
cladding, an attitude, a drawn internal, a certification rating or a
body style. So a gate valve and a ball valve are one class and two
variants, while a check valve is a class of its own -- it has no
actuator, and that is a fact about the device rather than its picture.

The low-level form is not going anywhere.
``Separator(variant="cyclone")`` stays supported indefinitely, and it is
the only way to reach the 130-odd drawings that never get a class of
their own; ``pandid.render.symbols.default_registry`` is still the whole
catalogue.

**One drawing, one nozzle vocabulary.** :class:`Cyclone`,
:class:`GravitySeparator` and :class:`ElectrostaticPrecipitator` collect
*dust*, and their drawings have anchored the catch ``liquid`` since
0.1.0. All three classes call it ``underflow`` and the gas draw
``overflow``, which is what classification and solid-liquid separation
call them.

``Separator(variant="cyclone")`` draws the same pair. The ``vapor``/
``liquid`` spelling it carried up to 0.1.1 still resolves, with a
:class:`DeprecationWarning` and a ``deprecated`` finding on
``fs.validate()``, and is gone in 0.1.3. The artwork is untouched: the
anchors it shipped with are mapped in
:attr:`pandid.units.Separator._VARIANT_ANCHORS`.

Not star-imported into :mod:`pandid.units`: this module imports its
bases from there, so that would be a genuine cycle. Use ``from pandid
import devices``, or take the names off the package, which re-exports
them all.
