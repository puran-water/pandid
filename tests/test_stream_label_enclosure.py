"""A stream label ruled inside a shape: ``fs.stream_labels.enclosure`` (#480).

**A drafting convention and not a standard.** A stream number in a diamond is
widespread in North American practice and in the chemical-engineering
textbooks, which is why courses and company drawing standards ask for it. No
clause of ISO 10628 or ISO 15519 prescribes a shape around a stream number, so
nothing here is asserted as conformance: what is asserted is that the option
draws what it says, that the default is untouched, and that the two backends
draw one drawing.

Four things carry the weight.

**The enclosure is what the search reserves.** A stream label sits *on* its
line and a shape is bigger than the words in it. If the placement search went
on reserving the words alone, the shape would be drawn over paper nothing had
accounted for -- so ``StreamNumber.box`` *is* the enclosure, and every check
here is against that one box.

**An enclosed label never leaves its run** (#480, decided by the owner). The
displacement path a bare label takes -- beside the line, or out to a leader --
is not taken, because a diamond off its run has no reading at all while one
too big for its run is merely crowded. Crowding is the drafter's to fix by
spacing the sheet, and it is reported so they can.

**No label paints out a line that is not its own**, at any setting. The shape
is an outline -- a filled one is a plate the size of a diamond and deletes
whatever run crosses it -- and the plate under the words is laid only where it
covers the labelled run alone. Where a run offers no such place, no plate is
laid: the number is written straight onto the sheet and the crossing run is
drawn through it. A drawing showing a connection that is not there is worse
than a crowded one, and ``validate()`` cannot see the difference because the
topology is untouched.

**One size for the whole sheet.** Measured over the longest label and given to
every label, the way the stream table rules its columns (#477).

``to_drawio()`` cannot rule a diamond round an edge label -- mxGraph has
``labelBorderColor`` and it draws a rectangle -- so an enclosed number leaves
the edge and becomes a vertex of its own. The geometry checks below are what
says the vertex lands where the sheet draws the shape, and reports what the
sheet reports.

    A stream label is written on an opaque plate, and a plate laid across a

    things that are not true -- that the line ends there, and that the gap is
    blank paper -- and ``validate()`` sees neither, because the topology is
    untouched. Ruling a shape is what takes away the search's room to dodge:
    an enclosed label may not leave its run (#480), and unfilling the shape
    was not enough on its own, since the plate under the words is opaque too.
    Thirteen of the 286 plates on this corpus landed across a crossing pipe
    that way -- thirteen 13-unit breaks in lines the sheet says are continuous
    -- where the same corpus lettered bare breaks none at all.

    So the plate is laid only where it covers the labelled run alone, and
    where the run offers no such place it is not laid at all
    (``StreamNumber.words`` is ``None``): the number goes straight onto the
    sheet and the crossing run is drawn through it in full. A number a passing

    ``21_alumina_refinery``, because ``_ink`` had no hop in it to compare

    Both directions, because the two backends now have a rule to disagree
    about. A number in a ``box`` follows its line; one in a ``diamond`` stays
    upright however the line runs, and the export reads
    :attr:`~pandid.render.svg.StreamNumber.vertical` rather than re-deriving
    the direction from the geometry, which is what keeps them one drawing. A
    single-shape check would pass on an exporter that turned everything or
    nothing, so ``any_turned`` pins which case each shape is.
