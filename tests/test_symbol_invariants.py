"""Symbol-invariant tests over EVERY (kind, variant) in the registry.

These are the defects the other render tests cannot reach -- a port placed in
empty space, a stroke half-clipped by an SVG viewport, a label struck through
by a line -- because those tests only ever exercise the handful of symbols the
example flowsheets happen to use. Every registered symbol is checked here, so a
newly added one gets the same scrutiny for free.

Geometry is approximated, not hit-tested exactly: SVG path/rect/ellipse/
circle/line/polygon primitives are flattened into straight-line segments
(elliptical arcs are properly sampled since several vessel-head ports sit on
one; Bezier curves are chorded between their anchor points, since ports are
never authored to sit mid-curve), and a port only has to land within
``GEOM_TOL`` of the nearest segment -- coarse by design, enough to catch a
port floating several units off a vessel wall without attempting exact path
hit-testing.

# Ports, and the nozzles the artwork draws for them (#225).
#
# ``test_ports_lie_on_drawn_geometry`` above holds every port to the ink, and
# that is not the same question. A stencil that draws an explicit nozzle has
# said something stronger than "there is a wall here": a nozzle drawn on a
# vessel is a statement that a connection exists *at that point*, and a port
# somewhere else on the same drawing is the drawing disagreeing with itself.
# Both halves of #225 passed the ink check and were wrong -- ``tank/sphere``'s
# inlet sat on the crown midway between the two nozzles drawn either side of
# it, and its outlet sat on the base rail of the support skirt, ten units below
# the nozzle the stencil drew for it and on the structure rather than on the
# vessel.
#
# This is the companion of ``nozzle-unconnected`` (#209). That finding reads a
# *numbered* nozzle a sheet did not pipe; this reads a *drawn* one the class
# cannot pipe at all, which is a defect one layer further down and is caught
# without a flowsheet.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A DRAWN NOZZLE. In the draw.io P&ID stencils a nozzle is a
# short rectangular stub standing off the shell with a flange line ruled across
# its free end. All three parts are required here, because each of them is what
# tells a nozzle from something else the artwork draws:
#
#   - a *rectangle*, small against the box on both axes (``_NOZZLE_STUB``),
#     which is what ``vessel/jacketed``'s full-height jacket panels, a
#     submersible pump's mounting plate and a damper's body are not;
#   - a *flange*, a straight line on the same axis as one of the rectangle's
#     four faces, centred on it and longer than it, which is what makes that
#     face the free end and gives the connection its point;
#   - and an overhang short enough to read as a flange (``_NOZZLE_FLANGE``),
#     which is what a submersible pump's 90-unit casing line across a 14-unit
#     rectangle is not.
#
# The sweep that settled these numbers runs ``_drawn_nozzles`` over every entry
# in ``default_registry`` -- 229 of them today, which is what ``_SYMBOLS``
# parametrises -- and exactly two answer to all three parts above: ``tank/sphere``,
# whose stub is the process nozzle this pair of tests is about, and
# ``separator/knockout``, whose is the gauge named below and is excluded by
# ``_NOT_NOZZLES``. If a later vendoring adds a third, it gets both invariants
# for free -- which is the whole point, since the port map is authored by hand in
# ``scripts/vendor_symbols.py`` and the artwork is not.

#: carrying the two vertical lines of the glass -- and the outer of those two
#: reads as a flange across the stub's end. It is a gauge and not a connection:
#: nothing flows through it, ``Separator`` has no port for one, and the giveaway
#: in the artwork is that there is a second line drawn *outboard* of the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where a valve's run sits in its box.
#
# scripts/vendor_symbols.py states the principle for the vessel family:
# "Switching a vessel between variants is a change of artwork, not of piping,
# so the two must offer the same nozzles in the same places." A valve the run
# goes straight through answers to the same rule, and its nozzles are on the
# body, which is the part that sits in the line.
#
# So the fixed height is measured from the BOTTOM of the box, not the top. An
# operator is drawn *above* the body -- a handwheel, a motor box, a diaphragm
# dome -- so choosing an actuated variant makes the box taller by adding to the
# top of it, and the body underneath stays where it was. valves.xml draws it
# that way: on every actuated shape the bowtie's lower edge is the bottom of the
# shape and the operator occupies the space above.
#
# Measured from the top the family is not one family at all. A gate valve's
# nozzles are 7.5 below the top of its box and a motor-operated one's are 14.9,
# so swapping the two under a corner pin drops the run 7.4 units -- half a valve
# body -- with nothing in the flowsheet having said anything about piping.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: How far above the bottom of its box a valve carries the run, in symbol-space
#: units. valves.xml draws the plain bowtie 60 units tall, with the run through
#: its crossing point and its lower edge on the bottom of the shape, so the
#: centreline is 30 units up; ``SCALE["valve"] = 0.25`` makes that a 15.0-tall
#: body in a 24.5 x 15.0 box with the run 7.5 above the bottom of it. Sixteen of
#: the nineteen straight-through variants land on it.
_VALVE_RUN_HEIGHT = 7.5

#: One unit of the stencil's own coordinate space, at ``SCALE["valve"] = 0.25``.
#:
#: Every source of scatter in the conforming sixteen is sub-unit in the space
#: the stencil author drew in, so a drawing cannot express a finer distinction
#: than this and anything inside it is the same centreline:
#:
#: * the bowtie is not one size across valves.xml. It is 60 units tall on the
#:   bare bodies, on Manual Operated (y 5..65) and on Check Valve 1 (y 2..62),
#:   but 59 on Motor/Solenoid/Hydraulic (y 30..89), Pneumatic Operated
#:   (y 20..79) and Back Pressure Regulator 1 (y 35..94). Half of 59 against
#:   half of 60 is 0.5 stencil units of it;
#: * the nozzle's height is a draw.io ``<constraint>`` authored as a *fraction*
#:   of the shape's height and rounded to two or three decimals -- 0.5, 0.54,
#:   0.63, 0.67, 0.685 -- against shapes 60 to 94 tall. One hundredth of an
#:   89-tall shape is 0.89 units, so the fraction cannot land on the body's
#:   centre: it misses by up to 1 unit (Check Valve 1, whose 0.5 is the middle
#:   of the shape while the bowtie inside it is offset 2 units down);
#: * and the generator rounds what it emits to one decimal, 0.2 units here.
#:
#: NOT the quantisation of ``SCALE["valve"] = 0.25`` itself, which was the first
#: guess: that rounding is worth at most +/-0.05 on each of the two numbers, and
#: the exact pre-rounding heights are already spread 7.3075 (pneumatic) to 7.75
#: (check). The scatter is in the stencils, and the drawn-body sizes are most of
#: it. Worst case in the shipped registry is 0.2 (check at 7.7, and the three
#: letter-box operators at 7.3), so this accepts the family with 0.05 to spare
#: and rejects all three exceptions below by an order of magnitude.

# The rule the pneumatic butterfly's defect was evidence for, said forwards.
# ``SCALE["valve"] = 0.25`` is one number applied to a whole stencil file, and
# it is calibrated to that file's ~98-unit module: it is what puts a Gate
# Valve's 98 x 60 bowtie in the 24.5 x 15.0 box the reference sheet is cut to.
# A shape drawn on any OTHER module therefore comes out at the wrong weight
# unless something makes up the difference, and "wrong weight" is not a matter
# of taste: an undersized body carries its nozzles with it, which is how the
# butterfly ended up drawing its run 5.0 above the bottom of its box instead of
# the family's 7.5.
#
# What the difference is measured in is the BODY, not the box. These are upright
# devices and the box holds whatever rides above the body -- a spring bonnet, a
# diaphragm dome -- so a rule stated about boxes would shrink the part that
# carries the flow to make room for the part that does not. ``angle`` is the
