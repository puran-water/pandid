"""No public entry point may accept an argument it then discards.

Every silent-discard defect found in the last fortnight has one shape: a
signature offers a word, the author types it, and nothing on the sheet is any
different. ``debug=True`` into the draw.io exporter, ``jump_direction``
misspelled and read as ``== "vertical"``, ``kind="material"`` overwritten on a
utility port, ``pin(port=...)`` resolving a nozzle and recording nothing. Each
was found by a different review and fixed on its own; #495 asks instead for the
rule, and for the test that finds the *next* one.

The rule, and what "honoured" means here
----------------------------------------

    An argument a public entry point accepts must be capable of changing what
    that entry point does.

Stated as a test rather than as a wish: hand the argument a value **no code in
this package could sensibly mean**, and the call must either raise, or produce
a different sheet. If it returns the same drawing, the same model and the same
findings as the call that never mentioned the argument at all, then the
argument had no consequence -- it was accepted and dropped. That is the whole
detection, and it is why the check is *behavioural* rather than a comparison of
two signatures: #492 already holds ``to_svg``'s keywords against the renderer's,
and that seam is exactly one seam. A keyword can be forwarded correctly and
still be read by nobody.

Two probe values, not one, because "no consequence" has two spellings. A
parameter whose default is falsy (``debug=False``) reacts to any truthy value,
and one whose default is truthy (``isolation=True``) reacts to none of them --
so the probes are an alien object and a *falsy* alien object, and an argument
counts as honoured when **either** of them makes a difference.

What the second probe is worth is measured rather than argued about, and it is
the opposite of quiet: delete ``_FalsyAlien()`` from :data:`PROBES` and nine
checks fail. Eight are arguments that *are* read and would be reported dropped
-- ``isolation``, ``reducers`` and ``bypass`` on both ``add_valve_station``
cases, and ``auto_faces`` through the constructor and again through its setter
-- and the ninth is
:func:`test_the_falsy_probe_is_what_finds_an_argument_whose_default_is_true`,
which plants the shape on a case of its own so that the reason arrives beside
the failure. #528 said the opposite of this in its body and here: that the
flags would stop being checked at all. A loud false failure and a silent gap
are not the same thing, and this file least of all can afford prose that does
not match what running it does.

An honoured verdict is only as strong as what the probe could reach, though.
An argument counts as honoured as soon as *a* probe makes a difference -- and
a probe that is **refused** has made one. That is the second tier's whole
subject, below.

Two tiers, because a refusal is not an answer
--------------------------------------------

An argument that is *refused* has changed what the call did, so it passes the
rule above -- and all it has proved is that something inspected it. Whether
anything after that read it is a different question, and it is where both
measurements of #528 missed -- five times between them, and nowhere else:
``pandid draw`` checks ``--border`` against its own ``choices`` and hands
``render()`` a None; ``to_svg`` checks ``page_size`` and draws unpaged.

So the check is asked twice. The second time the values are ones the package
itself says the argument takes, and **two of them must make the call do
different things**
(:func:`test_two_values_the_package_accepts_do_not_do_the_same_thing`). They
are asked for rather than written down, from the two places this package
states them in a form a program can read:

* ``argparse``'s ``choices`` -- ``--border`` offers ``none`` and ``zone``, and
  ``--crossing-style`` takes its list from
  :data:`pandid.render.svg.CROSSING_STYLES`, so a fourth style is probed here
  the day it is added;
* a **boolean default**. ``tabulate: bool = False`` says in the signature that
  both values are meant, which is what reaches a flag that is *validated* --
  ``_flag(data["tabulate"])`` refuses an alien, and the alien learns nothing.

A vocabulary is keyed by the argument's name and then used wherever that name
turns up, because a keyword, a spec key and a property setter that share one
are one argument arriving through three doors: ``auto_faces`` is
``Flowsheet(auto_faces=...)``, ``"auto_faces"`` in a spec file, and
``fs.auto_faces =``, and all three are probed with True and False.

The cost is the one #528 named: **a fixture per configuration in which the
values can show**. Where a fixture could carry the feature, it now does --
:func:`_crossed_sheet` is the sheet the command line is given, so that
``--crossing-style`` has two lines crossing to style and ``pandid validate``
has an untabulated line over the sheet edge to report differently for a PFD
than for a BFD; and a render case that is not about one particular drawing is
built on a P&ID, which is the drawing with the most on it. Where it could not
-- a stream table drawn as the sheet has no diagram under it, whatever the
fixture -- that is a line in :data:`INDISTINGUISHABLE` with a reason, held as
strictly as :data:`INAPPLICABLE`: if the values start differing, the line is
out of date and this file fails until it comes out.

What this cannot see, said plainly
----------------------------------

It reads consequences, never intent. An argument read into the wrong field, or
honoured with the wrong sign, changes the sheet and passes here. So does one
whose only effect is a value this file's witness does not look at -- which is
why the witness is deliberately wide: what the call returned, the model it
left (``to_dict``), the sheet that model draws (``to_svg``) and the findings it
recorded (``warnings``).

Two holes in particular, both measured rather than assumed -- each was left in
the package on purpose and this file was watched not to notice:

1. **Validated at the door and dropped on the way through.** A probe that is
   *refused* proves the argument reached a validator, and nothing beyond it.
   #528 planted eleven defects and missed three, an independent review planted
   nine and missed two, and all five misses were this one shape -- so the
   second tier below is aimed at exactly it, and closes as much of it as the
   package states its own accepted values in a form a program can read.

   What is left is the rest of that sentence. A vocabulary comes from
   ``action.choices`` and from a boolean default, and an argument whose
   accepted set is a private table with nothing tying it to the argument's name
   has none: ``page_size`` is checked against
   ``pandid.render.svg._PAGE_SIZES`` and ``--page-size`` offers no ``choices``;
   ``Valve.fail`` is checked against ``FAIL_POSITIONS``; a stream ``color`` is
   checked as text. Each of those can still be validated and then dropped
   without failing anything here, which is measured rather than assumed --
   three planted defects of that shape, one per table, all three missed. What
   would close it is a way to say *which* table an argument is checked against
   that is not a list of argument names in this file, and there is not one
   today. For the render chain the seam is also held by #492's guard in
   ``tests/test_stream_table_sheet.py``, holding each entry point's keywords
   against its backend's, and by ``tests/test_show.py``.
2. **Refused, but not by name.** #495 asks that a refusal name the argument.
   Several here raise something legible only to a Python programmer --
   ``AttributeError: '_Alien' object has no attribute 'upper'`` for a bad
   ``page_size`` -- and that counts as honoured. Demanding the name would flag
   forty-odd parameters whose fault is a missing type check rather than a
   silent discard, which is a different issue from this one.

``**opts`` is out of reach by construction: a catch-all has no parameter name to
poison. What replaces it is the other half of #492's rule, checked here for
every entry point that has one --
:func:`test_an_entry_point_with_a_catch_all_refuses_an_unknown_keyword`.

Declaring that an argument cannot apply
---------------------------------------

Some arguments legitimately do nothing in some configurations, and that is not
a defect. Three shapes of it turn up:

* a **protocol default**. ``Unit.repeats()`` answers False for every argument,
  because no piece of equipment is a second drawing of another one; the
  parameter is there for :meth:`Instrument.repeats` and :meth:`Tee.repeats` to
  read, and both are exercised here.
* an argument whose **companion is absent**. ``add_valve_station(gap=...)``
  measures a run that is only laid out when ``x`` and ``y`` are both given --
  the shape this table's four filed entries took, and the shape they left by.
  #527 refuses ``mirrored``, ``gap``, ``bypass_rise`` and ``drain_drop`` on a
  station with no coordinates instead of declaring them inert, and that is the
  answer wherever it is available: a missing companion is a *declaration* only
  where there is nothing to say back.
* an argument with **nothing to act on**. ``check=`` refuses a sheet with
  errors; a sheet with none has nothing to refuse. (Rather than declare that
  five times over, the render fixture here carries one deliberate error and
  every render case passes ``check=False`` in its baseline -- see
  :func:`_faulty_sheet`.)

The example that prompted the question -- ``connections="flanged"`` on a stream
table sheet, accepted and marking nothing -- turns out **not** to need one, and
the reason is worth keeping: ``to_svg`` checks ``connections`` before it decides
whether there is a diagram to mark, so a nonsense value is refused on a table
sheet exactly as it is on a drawing. An argument that is validated wherever it
is accepted is one this file can leave alone whether or not it applies, which
is another way of saying that #492 got that call right.

There is **one** place to say so, :data:`INAPPLICABLE`, and saying so is not
free: a declaration is held to be *true*. If a declared-inert argument turns
out to have an effect, this file fails and the line must go. That is what keeps
the table from becoming somewhere to put a failure.

A declaration that cites an issue number is a **defect that has been filed and
not yet fixed**, not a design decision; the two live in one table because the
guard treats them identically, and are told apart by
:attr:`Inapplicable.issue`.

Three tables excuse a check in this file, and all three are held to the same
rules: :data:`INAPPLICABLE`, for an argument with no effect at all here;
:data:`INDISTINGUISHABLE`, for one that *does* reach something and whose values
this configuration cannot tell apart; and :data:`UNEXERCISED`, for an entry
point no case can call. Every one of them must give a reason worth reading --
:func:`_reason_worth_reading`, one predicate, shared so the three cannot drift
apart. They had: until #529 an **empty** ``UNEXERCISED`` reason passed, so "no
case can be written for this" needed nothing after the comma, which is the one
thing that turns a declaration table into somewhere to put a failure.

Guarding the guard
------------------

Three PRs in one night shipped a regression guard that passed with its own
machinery stubbed out, so every mechanism this file leans on is broken on
purpose at the bottom and shown to produce a failure:

* the **enumeration** takes the namespace it walks as an argument, so a stub
  namespace with a planted class proves it finds one, and an empty one proves
  it reports nothing rather than everything;
* the **engine** is run against a function that provably swallows its argument
  and against one that provably reads it, and must tell them apart;
* the **tables** are validated by functions that take the table, so a
  fabricated table with a stale key, a blank reason or a malformed issue
  number is shown to be reported;
* the **second tier** is run against a planted entry point that checks its
  argument against a list and then draws the same thing whichever it was, and
  against one that checks it and then uses it, and must tell those apart --
  and the first of the two is shown to pass the *first* tier, which is the
  whole reason there is a second;
* the **vocabularies** are read off a parser and a signature this file makes
  up, including a dest two subcommands disagree about, which is dropped rather
  than guessed at and reported rather than dropped quietly;
* the **parametrisation** -- both tiers of it -- is asserted non-empty and to
  contain named pairs, so a signature reader that quietly returned nothing
  cannot make the whole file pass by having nothing to check.
