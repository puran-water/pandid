"""What a line number on a drawn sheet has to be, over the whole shipped corpus.

**A line number is written along the line it names, or carries a leader to it.**

That is BS ISO 15519-1:2010 §7.2.5, on the reference designation of a
connection, and both halves of it are *shall*: the designation is oriented along
or beside the connecting line it belongs to, and where there is no room beside
that line it goes elsewhere in the content area with a leader drawn back to it
(the clause points on to 6.4).

Nothing asserted it. The placement search walked outward from the pipe until it
found paper nothing else had claimed and wrote the number there, however far out
that turned out to be, with nothing joining it to its line -- and on
``11_ethanol_pid`` three numbers ended up 30 units of blank paper from their own
run, close against a vessel, a valve tag and a reboiler shell respectively
(issue #155 item 4). The avoidance was working; the outcome defeated its
purpose, and every test passed.

*Along* is measured as overlap and not as a gap, which is the second thing this
file has been wrong about. The first version of these checks read "adjacent" as
a distance across the paper and asserted a cap on it, and that cap was
answering a question no reader asks. ``FB-306-100-160-SS`` on 11 stands two
bands off its own run and is not in the least ambiguous, because the run goes
the whole length of the number and out past both ends; it was given a leader for
being far away, and the leader is what put a second reading on the sheet, since
it lands under one half of a number that was already sitting over its line.
What decides it is whether the line is *there*, beside the words: a caption is
attached by lying against the thing it captions, and a string that has run out
past the end of its own line is lying against something else instead.

The checks read the drawn SVG rather than the placement code, because what the
clause is about is what a reader sees. Each label's halo, its text and the
leader that may follow are picked out of the ``streams`` group in document
order, and measured against the polyline its own line is drawn as.

The run measured against is the whole straight length of the labelled line the
label lies along, not one drawn segment of it: an in-line valve splits a
straight run of pipe into three pieces and a reader sees one line. It has to be
parallel to the label, too, since a number written along a horizontal run is not
made to lie along anything by a vertical stub of the same line passing near its
end.

§6.4 governs the leader itself, and its three checks are here too: the leader
lands *on* the line it names, it is oblique, and it cuts nothing. Oblique
matters because §12.1 holds every connecting line -- pipes, mechanical links,
conductors, functional connections -- to horizontal or vertical, so the
slope is what stops a leader being read as a connection; ISO 15519-1's own
Figure 4 c), the case of a leader landing on a plain connection, draws it that
way. And cutting nothing matters because the label was moved out here to avoid
deleting somebody else's ink in the first place: a leader that runs through what
the halo stepped around has moved the defect rather than fixed it.

    Both directions matter.  A number with no clean answer inside the bounded
    search is the explicit exception: it has no leader by design and the
    structured finding is what prevents that incomplete placement being issued
    silently.  Every other label must satisfy exactly one side of the rule.
