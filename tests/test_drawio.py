"""The draw.io export, and the one thing about it that cannot be tested here.

**draw.io is not run.** Nothing in this file opens the exported document in
draw.io or in anything else that speaks mxGraph, so nothing here is evidence
that a sheet *looks right* when a reader opens one. What is left is still worth
having, and it is the part that fails silently:

* the document parses, and is the ``mxfile > diagram > mxGraphModel > root``
  shape draw.io reads, with every cell parented and every edge joining two cells
  that exist;
* **every shape reference resolves.** This is the check the whole export turns
  on. draw.io answers a ``shape=`` it cannot resolve with a plain rectangle
  rather than an error, so a mistyped, stale or invented key produces a file
  that opens perfectly and has quietly stopped being a P&ID. Every symbol the
  library can draw is walked, and each reference is held against the shape keys
  built *here*, from the vendored stencil XML, by draw.io's own rule -- deriving
  them again rather than calling the generator's function, so that a bug in the
  rule has to be made twice to pass;
* the geometry is the SVG renderer's. Every box, every waypoint and every
  connection point is compared against what :mod:`pandid.render.svg` and
  :mod:`pandid.portgeom` compute for the same sheet, so the exported drawing and
  the rendered one cannot drift apart.

The connection-point check needs one caveat of its own. It applies *this file's
model* of how draw.io resolves a fixed connection point -- fraction of the box,
then the cell's flips -- and asserts the emitted fractions land back on the
nozzle. That catches an inverted flip or a fraction taken against the wrong box,
which is what it is for. It cannot catch a mistake in the model itself; only
opening the file can.

    ISO 15519-2 §5.2.5 makes a high or low function *lettering* beside the

    belongs to no cell: it is not a unit's label and not a line's. So the

    them -- `PAH`, `PAL`, `TAH`, `TAL`, `LAH` and `LAL` were on the rendered

    Six alarms said on the sheet and not said in the file a reader opens.

    The quadrant is checked with the text, because half of what a code says is
    where it is: §5.1.3 puts a high function above the centre line and a low one
    below, so a pair exported into one quadrant is a different statement about

    search was offered paper the sheet had already spent and took it --
    `AE-302-300-80-SS` over `HV-301A`, `FB-301-200-160-SS` over `XV-301`. And a
    number on a vertical run was written flat where the sheet turns it, so its
