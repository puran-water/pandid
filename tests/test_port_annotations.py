"""The port annotations and the ports themselves must say the same thing.

Every unit class writes its nozzles down twice: once as the ``PORTS`` tuples (or
the ``__init__`` calls) that build them, and once as bare ``suction: Port``
annotations that let mypy and an editor see them. Two spellings of one fact
drift, and this suite is what stops them: it walks every ``Unit`` subclass the
package defines, builds one, and checks the two halves against each other in
both directions.

Found rather than listed, so a class added tomorrow is covered without anyone
remembering to come here. The exemptions are named, and there are only four
kinds, each argued at the class or the module it applies to:

- the **numbered members** of a variable-sized family (``Mixer``'s ``in_1`` ...
  ``in_n``, ``Splitter``'s ``out_1`` ... ``out_n``, both of ``Block``'s and
  ``Junction``'s, the
  ``feed_1`` ... ``feed_n`` a second feed spells a ``Column``, ``Reactor`` or
  ``Separator`` with, and the ``draw_1`` ... ``draw_n`` a second draw spells a
  ``Column`` with -- the one class with *two* independent counted families),
  whose count is the caller's, so there is no finite set of names a class
  annotation could stand for one at a time.

  It is *only* the members. The family itself is perfectly declarable as a
  sequence -- ``inlets: tuple[Port, ...]`` -- and every one of them is
  declared, so the exemption is "this nozzle is reachable through a family the
  class declares" and not "this nozzle has a number on the end". A class cannot
  take it by naming a port ``thing_2``, and cannot use a family to get out of
  declaring a fixed nozzle: :func:`test_a_family_only_excuses_a_numbered_nozzle`
  is the ceiling and :func:`test_only_these_classes_declare_a_family` the floor;
- the **variant nozzles** (``HeatExchanger``'s ``bottoms``, ``Separator``'s
  ``overflow``), which belong to some variants and not others, so declaring them
  on the base class would tell a checker something false about every other one;
- the **superseded nozzles** of a class that replaces its base's whole nozzle
  list. All of these are :mod:`pandid.devices`'s generated classes --
  ``PlateExchanger`` has lettered sides and no shell, ``CheckValve`` has no
  actuator -- inheriting an annotation their base wrote for a nozzle they do
  not build, because Python has no way to un-declare one.
  ``__annotations__`` is merged down the MRO and there is no "delete", and
  re-annotating the name with something narrower is an incompatible
  override. So the phantom check answers for the annotations a class
  *writes*, and :func:`test_only_these_classes_supersede_a_declaration` is
  what keeps that from spreading past the eleven classes it is true of.

  ``units.Absorber`` and ``units.Stripper`` used to be here too, for the
  same reason: hand-written next to :class:`~pandid.units.Column`,
  inheriting four nozzles they do not build. #400 is why they are not
  anymore -- ``Column`` no longer declares those four at all, so there is
  nothing left for either class to inherit falsely. That is the fix this
  whole exemption exists to make unnecessary: a class the hierarchy tells
  the truth about needs no annotation-level patch;
- an **aliased nozzle** -- ``Reactor.feed``/``Column.feed``/``Separator.feed``,
  a bare name
  set beside ``feed_1`` in ``__init__`` rather than registered as a
  second port, so a one-feed vessel keeps the singular spelling without
  a ``PortSeries`` counting it twice (:func:`_family_aliases`). Found the
  same way the family exemption is: a name only counts if it really is a
  live attribute reaching a real member of a declared family, not a
  fixed list of classes.

#: and its usual declaration form -- ``inputs=["W", "W", "N"]`` -- carries no
#: length in its type, so the per-arity overloads the other families use would
#: need a class per (inputs, outputs) pair and would still miss the list form.
_CHECKER_VISIBLE_GETATTR = {"Block"}

#: The families answered *exactly* instead: a literal count picks an overload
#: returning a subclass that declares those nozzles and no others, so
#: ``Mixer("M", n_inlets=3).in_4`` is an error and so is ``.outlt``. Maps each
#: class to a tuple of the families *it* generates, one ``(keyword, member,
#: suffix)`` per family:
#:
#: - ``keyword`` is the constructor argument that sets the count
#:   (``n_inlets``, ``n_draws``, ...);
#: - ``member`` is the nozzle stem the count numbers (``in`` builds ``in_1``
#:   ... ``in_n``);
#: - ``suffix`` is what sits between the class name and the arity in the
#:   generated class's own name -- ``""`` for ``Mixer3``, and ``"Draw"`` for
#:   ``ColumnDraw3``, which is what tells the two families on one class apart
#:   without a second dict alongside this one.
#:
#: Every class here carries one family but ``Column``, which carries two:
#: ``n_feeds`` (suffix ``""``, the ordinary case a plain ``Column`` always
#: had) and ``n_draws`` (suffix ``"Draw"``, added beside it). The two are
#: independent rather than crossed -- see ``Column.__new__``'s own comment --
#: so ``feed``'s per-arity classes and ``draw``'s are two separate walks over
#: 1..8, not one walk over 64 combinations.
#:
#: ``Reactor`` is here despite ``StirredTankReactor`` adding ``duty``,
#: ``outlet`` and ``vent``: all three are already declared on ``Reactor`` too
#: (``set(devices.StirredTankReactor.__annotations__) -
#: set(units.Reactor.__annotations__)`` is empty), so narrowing ``Reactor``'s
#: own ``__new__`` to ``Reactor2`` loses nothing a stirred tank has. What a
#: narrower *base* return type would still break is the subclass's own
#: assignability -- ``t: StirredTankReactor = StirredTankReactor("R")`` wants
#: ``StirredTankReactor``, not ``Reactor2`` -- so ``scripts/gen_devices.py``
#: gives every generated subclass of a family base its own overloads and its
#: own ``ClassNameN`` classes rather than reusing the base's; see that
#: script's ``arity_family``.
#:
#: ``Absorber``, ``Stripper`` and ``DistillationColumn`` are here for
#: ``n_feeds`` only. All three still *take* ``n_draws=``/``draw_stages=``
#: at run time -- they are ``Column``'s own keywords and none of the three
#: subclasses overrides ``__init__`` -- but none gets a second overload
#: family of its own for it: copying ``Column``'s two-family trade onto
#: every narrower-or-wider subclass too would spend the class-explosion
#: problem a second, a third and a fourth time for a combination narrower
#: still than the one ``Column`` already declines to cross-type. So
#: ``absorber.draw_2`` does not resolve even where ``n_draws=2`` really
#: built it; ``absorber.draws[i]`` or ``absorber.port("draw_2")`` is the
#: typed route there, exactly as ``m.inlets[i]`` is for a *computed*
#: ``n_inlets`` everywhere else in this table.
#:
#: ``Separator`` carries one family and crosses nothing, unlike ``Column``:
#: which *draws* a separator has is fixed by its ``variant=`` rather than by
#: a count, so there is no second arity to pair ``n_feeds`` with. Its
#: ``variant="horizontal"`` refuses a second feed outright (see
#: ``Separator._ONE_FEED_VARIANTS``), which is a run-time refusal and not
#: something these overloads can express: the classes below are built at the
#: default variant, which is the one every arity really has.
#:
#: ``Tank`` and ``Vessel`` are here for ``inputs`` only, on the same
#: trade: both default to one outlet, so ``outputs=`` above one is the
#: combination this table declines to cross-type, exactly as
#: ``Absorber``'s ``n_draws`` is. ``tank.outlets[i]`` /
#: ``tank.port("out_2")`` is the typed route there.
