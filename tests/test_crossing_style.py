"""Which mark a crossing carries is the author's choice (#499).

Three conventions, and the documents on disk do not agree between them:
ISO 10628-1 5.3.4 interrupts one of the two lines, ISO 15519-1 12.5 Figure 31
draws both straight through, and the semicircular bridge pandid has always
drawn is in neither. ``crossing_style`` offers all three, and the default is
the interruption 5.3.4 asks for: 4.1 puts block diagrams, PFDs and P&IDs alike
under Clause 5, so the rule does not vary by diagram type and the package
should not either. The bridge stays available for a house style that wants it.

What this file holds, and what it deliberately does not:

* **The default is a named constant, not a word.** Byte equality against the 21
  goldens is ``tests/test_golden.py``'s job and is not restated here; what is
  restated is that *naming* the default draws the same bytes as not naming it,
  on both backends, on every corpus sheet that has a crossing to draw. The
  cases say ``CROSSING_STYLE_DEFAULT`` rather than the word it currently holds,
  so they keep saying the same thing the next time it changes.
* **Each style draws its own mark and nothing else.** Measured against the
  same run drawn with nothing crossing it, so ``"plain"`` cannot pass by
  drawing something else that happens not to be an arc.
* **The two backends mark the same runs.** Divergence is a failure, not a
  finding: an export that hops what the sheet interrupts says the drawing is
  something it is not.
* **An unknown spelling raises, and a known one is handed on.** Accepted-and-
  ignored is the failure mode this option is written against, and it is the
  one ``jump_direction`` beside it was fixed for in #481. Both halves are
  checked here: the word is refused at every call that takes it, *and* every
  call that takes it passes it down -- ``render()`` accepting the keyword and
  dropping it on the way to ``to_svg()`` is the same swallowing wearing a
  different hat, and is what this file caught during the writing of it.
* **``crossing-unmarked`` follows the style.** The finding exists since #490;
  what is new is that it names the mark the sheet was drawing and falls silent
  under ``"plain"``, which drew every crossing exactly as it said it would.

It does **not** hold that the interruption is legible everywhere. It is not:
the break comes out of the run, so a crossing near a corner leaves a short
stub. That is measured on #499 and stays #498's to fix in the router; the
deliverable here is the choice, and the docstrings say what choosing it costs.
