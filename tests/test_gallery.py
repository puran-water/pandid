"""``docs/gallery/``: the committed sheets, against the goldens of the same drawings.

The gallery is generated -- twenty-one examples rendered to SVG and rasterised to
PNG by ``scripts/gallery.py`` -- and until this file existed nothing held it to
its source. It drifted, and drifted invisibly: ``04_control_loop.svg`` sat on
``main`` through a dozen rendering PRs showing a sheet 526 px tall with an
instrument panel on it and no LT-101, which was a drawing the package had
stopped producing. Every one of those PRs was individually right to say "a
re-rasterise is coming"; what was missing was anything that noticed it had not.

That is the same gap ``_vendored_symbols.py`` had before #150 and ``docs/api.md``
had before #179, and this is the same answer: regenerate and compare.

**Why the golden and not a fresh render.** The sheet under ``docs/gallery/`` and
the one under ``tests/golden/`` are the same drawing out of the same example, so
re-rendering every example here asserted a third time what ``tests/test_golden.py``
already asserts twice: that ``examples/NN.py`` draws what is committed. #302
measured what the third copy cost -- rewording one SVG comment, a change that
moves no geometry at all, failed 64 tests, of which 43 carried all of the
information. So this compares the two *committed* artefacts to each other and
leaves the renderer to ``test_golden.py``, which renders every example already,
and does it twice: from its own fixture and from the example.

The two corpora are one corpus, which is what makes that sound:
``test_golden.test_every_example_has_a_fixture`` asserts its scenarios are
exactly :func:`gallery.sheets`, so every sheet here has a golden behind it and
every golden is held to the example that draws it. A stale gallery still fails
here -- against the drawing the example is known to draw, rather than against a
third render of it.

The two are compared without an exception of any kind, which took a change in
``test_golden.py`` to be able to say. ``03`` and ``08`` leave ``TitleBlock.date``
blank; the fixture used to pin it to a constant while ``scripts/gallery.py``
stamped the sheet's issue date, so the two committed artefacts stood one cell
apart for a reason that was about neither drawing, and this file had to hold a
rule for telling that cell from a real one. ``test_golden.py`` now pins the
fixture to the same date the generator stamps -- the top of the sheet's own
revision history -- and holds every scenario to it in
``test_no_fixture_dates_a_sheet_differently_from_the_generator``, so the two
agree and the rule is gone rather than written more carefully.

What is no longer re-run is :func:`gallery.render`, and only its own two lines:
the capture underneath it still runs over every example, since ``test_golden``'s
pass over the examples goes through that same :func:`gallery.flowsheet`. So a
sheet regenerated through a broken ``to_svg`` or ``normalize`` is caught on the
run after the regeneration rather than on the one that broke it. That is the
whole of what this trades away.

**Why the whole gallery, on every push.** Comparing every sheet is two file reads
apiece now, so neither cheaper design is worth the failure mode it brings.
Checking only the sheets whose example changed would have let this very drift
through, since the change that stales a sheet is often in ``pandid/`` rather
than in the example; and it needs a diff base, which a shallow CI clone does not
reliably have. Leaving it to a scheduled job means finding out after the merge.

**Why the SVG is compared exactly and the PNG is not.** The SVG is deterministic:
given the same code it is the same text, once ``<defs>`` ordering is
canonicalised -- :func:`test_golden._normalize`'s rule, imported rather than
restated, since two files compared under two rules are not compared at all.
``_normalize`` also empties the provenance block, and that half is *undone*
here rather than inherited: see
:func:`_with_the_provenance_the_renderer_writes`, which puts back what this
version of the renderer writes, so a committed sheet still has to name the
version it was drawn by. A PNG is a raster, and its bytes come out of
whichever PDFium build and font substitution the machine that made it had, so
comparing them across a five-interpreter Linux matrix against a file made on one
developer's machine would be a flake and not a check. What is checked about the
raster is the part that is platform-independent and is exactly what goes stale
when a drawing changes shape: it exists, it is the width the gallery declares,
and it is the shape of the sheet beside it. A drawing that changed *within* the
same outline is caught by the SVG comparison, which fails first and sends the
author back to the one command that rewrites both.
