The clause excepts from turning any symbol for a component or device whose
function depends on gravity, and names two of them: the open tank (2061) and
the cyclone separator (X 2618), drawn at Figure 22 b). Those must not be turned.

``Symbol.gravity_fixed`` marks them and ``validate()`` reports a turned one as
``gravity-turned``. A warning rather than an error: the sheet still draws, the
nozzles still land on ink, and the only thing wrong with it is what it says
about the plant.
