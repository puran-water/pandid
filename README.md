# pandid

Generate publication-quality P&IDs and process flow diagrams from a topological
flowsheet, in pure Python with no runtime dependencies.

[![Ethanol purification P&ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alpha9463/pandid/main/docs/gallery/11_ethanol_pid.png)](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/gallery/README.md)

<sub>[`examples/11_ethanol_pid.py`](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/examples/11_ethanol_pid.py): instrumentation, five control loops, hand-isolated valve stations, line numbers, a zone-ruled A3 frame, a title block and a general-notes box. See the [gallery](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/gallery/README.md) for the rest.</sub>

You describe what connects to what. The engine lays out the equipment, routes
every stream, and draws industry-standard symbols.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10 or later. Fully type-hinted and marked
[PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/), so `mypy` and `pyright` read the
annotations straight out of the wheel.

```bash
pip install pandid
pip install 'pandid[pdf]'    # optional PDF/PNG export backend (wheels only)
pip install 'pandid[yaml]'   # optional YAML spec reader (Flowsheet.from_yaml)
```

The `pdf` extra is wheels the whole way down (svglib, ReportLab, pypdfium2,
Pillow), so it needs no system libraries and no compiler on any platform.
`.svg` needs none of it: the engine has zero runtime dependencies.

From a checkout, `pip install -e '.[dev]'` adds pytest, ruff and mypy.

## Quick start

```python
from pandid import Flowsheet, Feed, Heater, Separator, Product

fs = Flowsheet("Flash Separation")
feed   = fs.add(Feed("Crude"))
heater = fs.add(Heater("E-101"))
drum   = fs.add(Separator("V-101"))
gas    = fs.add(Product("Off-Gas"))
liquid = fs.add(Product("Condensate"))

fs.connect(feed.outlet,   heater.inlet)
fs.connect(heater.outlet, drum.feed)
fs.connect(drum.vapor,    gas.inlet)
fs.connect(drum.liquid,   liquid.inlet)

fs.render("flash.svg")        # layout and routing run automatically
```

No coordinates anywhere. `render()` infers the format from the extension
(`.svg`, `.pdf`/`.png` with the optional backend, or `.drawio` to keep editing by
hand). `fs.to_svg()` returns the SVG string, `fs.show()` opens it in a browser,
and a flowsheet renders inline in Jupyter.

## What it does

- **Topology-first API.** Declare typed units and connect their named ports.
  Streams are created for you.
- **Automatic layout.** A nozzle fixed to a face places the unit that carries
  it -- a west port puts its block east of what feeds it, a crown puts the
  relief valve above the vessel -- solved as difference constraints, with
  crossing reduction and a centre-aligned flow spine over the top. Recycles
  are detected and routed around the sheet, instrumentation is placed against
  frozen process geometry, and a port that a symbol authors on several faces
  is piped from the face its peer is actually on.
- **Orthogonal A\* routing.** Right-angle streams with crossing jump-gaps and
  parallel-segment separation. Never emits a disconnected stream.
- **246 registered symbols** with style variants, so a heat exchanger can be
  shell-and-tube, plate, kettle or U-tube. They derive from the Apache-2.0
  draw.io P&ID stencils (see [`NOTICE`](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/NOTICE)).
- **Pixel-perfect overrides.** `pin()` equipment to exact coordinates and
  `.via()` a stream through explicit waypoints. The engine honours both and
  auto-routes the rest.
- **Line numbers.** A line is labelled the way the line list has it
  (`6"-P-1001-A1A`: size, service, sequence, spec, with schedule and insulation
  available too), not `S1`. The sequence is filled automatically, the number
  carries through in-line fittings and breaks at a spec break, and the
  convention is a format string you can replace.
- **Instrumentation to ISA-5.1.** Balloons anchored to the line or the equipment
  they read, tags drawn inside, location variants, alarms and interlock squares,
  typed signal lines, and controller outputs landing on a valve's actuator.
- **PFD, P&ID or BFD.** `diagram="p&id"` draws the sheet by the P&ID's own
  conventions, starting with the one every engineer notices: a process line
  carries no arrowhead. `diagram="pfd"` is the default and keeps them, and
  `diagram="bfd"` is a block flow diagram. The sheet says which it is, and
  `validate()` judges it by that drawing's own clause of ISO 10628-1.
- **Engineering sheet framing.** A full-width title strip with revision history,
  titled boxes docked to the corners (equipment list, notes, legend), a
  sectioned stream-property table, and an optional zone-ruled drawing border.
- **Declare it as data.** A round-trippable spec format (`dict`, JSON or YAML)
  covering all of the above, so an equipment list and a stream table go straight
  to a drawing. Validated, not interpreted: a typo names the entry and lists
  what would have worked.
- **Hand it to draw.io.** `fs.render("sheet.drawio")` writes an editable
  diagrams.net model, not a picture: the equipment symbols *are* draw.io's own
  P&ID stencils, so the file references them and what opens is a native shape
  you can drag. draw.io exports `.vsdx`, so it is also the way to Visio.
- **A command line.** `pandid draw plant.yaml -o plant.pdf` for the drawing,
  `pandid validate` for a check a build script can gate on, `pandid symbols` for
  what can be drawn.
- **Validation.** `fs.validate()` flags overlapping pins and off-sheet
  coordinates as errors, and routes crossing equipment or taking big detours as
  warnings.

**It does not do mass or energy balances.** Stream properties are strings you
supply, and nothing is calculated from them. This is a drawing engine.

## Standards

`pandid` draws in the idiom of the process-industry drawing standards. It does
not claim conformance to any of them, and nothing it produces has been certified
against one.

The set it works to is **ISO 10628-1** for the drawing rules, **ISO 15519-1** and
**-2** for what 10628-1 leaves to them, and **ANSI/ISA-5.1** for instrumentation.
That third choice is not an ISO one, and it shows in four places: the balloon
outlines, the pneumatic cross-hatch, the fail-position letters, and the absence
of direction arrowheads on a P&ID.

In summary:

- Equipment symbols follow the conventions of **ISO 10628-2**.
- Instrument balloons, signal lines and tag letters follow **ANSI/ISA-5.1**
  rather than the ISO 15519-2 route. ISO 15519-1 §7.1 licenses the **tag
  letters**, which are a reference designation. It reaches no further: the
  balloon outlines and the signal-line styles are a declared deviation, since
  ISO 15519-2 §5.1.1 gives a circle and an extended circle and nothing else.
- Line weights follow **ISO 15519-1 §6.2** and **ISO 15519-2 Annex A.1**, label
  placement **ISO 15519-1 §7.2.5**, and off-page connector text
  **ISO 15519-1 §9**.
- Sheet sizes are the **ISO 216** A series, declared in millimetres so a sheet
  prints at its physical size. The zone grid is an ASME-idiom drawing-frame
  reference and is **not** an ISO 5457 grid.
- The title block carries the data fields **ISO 7200** specifies.
- Valve fail position is drawn as letters on the authority of
  **PIP PIC001 clause 4.5.3.2**, and a normally closed valve is darkened on the
  authority of **clause 4.2.2.7**.

## Equipment

A class is a functional equipment type, defined by its ports. Import it from the
package and build it:

```python
from pandid import PlateExchanger, ControlValve, StirredTankReactor

fs.add(PlateExchanger("E-1"))
fs.add(ControlValve("FV-1", fail="closed"))
fs.add(StirredTankReactor("R-1"))
```

The base classes are `Feed`, `Product`, `Pump`, `Compressor`, `Blower`, `Valve`,
`Vessel`, `Tank`, `HeatExchanger`, `Heater`, `Cooler`, `CoolingTower`,
`Evaporator`, `Reactor`, `Separator`, `Thickener`,
`Column`, `Mixer`, `Splitter`, `Tee`, `Reducer`, `Fitting`, `Ejector`, `Vent`,
`Funnel`, `Furnace`, `Boiler`, `Stack`, `Flare`, `Turbine`, `Filter`, `Dryer`,
`Kiln`, `Crusher`,
`Mill`, `Conveyor`, `Elevator` and `Instrument`,
with 76 equipment classes over them — a `GearPump` *is* a `Pump`.

A variant is a drawing within a class, picked with `variant=`. 146 of the 246
registered drawings get no class of their own, and this is how you reach them:

```python
from pandid import units

fs.add(units.Valve("HV-301", variant="gate", normal_position="closed"))
fs.add(units.Column("T-1", variant="packed", n_feeds=2))
fs.add(units.Fitting("ST-1", variant="strainer"))
```

The [API reference](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/api.md#units-and-ports)
lists every class's ports and every registered variant, and
[Custom equipment](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/api.md#custom-equipment)
covers a `Unit` subclass of your own.

`Tee` is the fitting that branches a line, drawn as three lines meeting with
nothing at the junction. `add_valve_station()` builds the whole arrangement a
control valve sits in, twelve units and twelve streams, in one call.

## Declaring a flowsheet as data

An equipment list and a stream table are data, and usually already exist in a
spreadsheet or a simulator export. Hand the engine a plain mapping instead of
retyping it as Python.

```python
from pandid import Flowsheet

fs   = Flowsheet.from_dict(spec)         # a plain dict, from anywhere
fs   = Flowsheet.from_json("bfw.json")   # standard library only
fs   = Flowsheet.from_yaml("bfw.yaml")   # pip install 'pandid[yaml]'
spec = fs.to_dict()                      # writes the same spec back out

fs.render("bfw.svg", border="zone", show_stream_table=True)
```

`Flowsheet.from_dict(fs.to_dict())` rebuilds an equivalent flowsheet. Only
intent is written, never the engine's results, so the file stays short and
re-lays out cleanly. Every failure raises `pandid.SpecError`, naming the entry
and what would have worked. The
[spec format](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/api.md#declaring-a-flowsheet-as-data)
documents every section and key.

## Command line

Installing the package installs a `pandid` command, so a spec file becomes a
drawing without opening Python. `python -m pandid` is the same thing from a
checkout.

```bash
pandid draw plant.yaml -o plant.pdf --page-size A3 --border zone --stream-table
pandid validate plant.yaml
pandid symbols --kind valve
```

The exit codes are meant to be gated on: `0` done, `1` the flowsheet was
rejected, `2` the command line was wrong, `3` an optional extra is not
installed. Nothing prints a traceback at a mistyped file name or a typo in the
spec. See the
[command line reference](https://github.com/Alpha9463/pandid/blob/main/docs/api.md#command-line).

**Equipment symbols are Apache-2.0 and stay that way.** They derive from the

from a stencil rather than generated from one. The stencil artwork carries one
additional field-of-use restriction on top of Apache-2.0, naming Atlassian
